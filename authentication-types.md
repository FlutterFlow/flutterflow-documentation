# Overview
FlutterFlow provides native support for a variety of Authentication Services, including **Firebase**, **Supabase**, and **Custom Authentication** options. To integrate these services into your app, simply navigate to 'App Settings,' select 'Authentication,' and then choose your preferred service. From there, you can set up initial pages for both entry and logged-in states. Follow any additional steps as necessary to complete the setup.

## Firebase Authentication

In FlutterFlow, you can seamlessly connect with **Firebase** and utilize the available authentication
methods.

Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, leveraging industry
standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. This makes it highly adaptable for use with your custom
backend, ensuring a secure and scalable solution.

## Supabase Authentication

In FlutterFlow, you can also integrate Supabase to manage authentication efficiently.

Supabase provides a powerful and flexible authentication solution, similar to Firebase but with some
unique advantages like support for PostgreSQL.

## Custom Authentication

In FlutterFlow, you have the flexibility to implement custom authentication solutions tailored to
your specific needs. This allows for a highly personalized approach to security, enabling you to
design and integrate authentication mechanisms that perfectly fit the unique requirements of your
application. Whether you need to work with legacy systems or have specific security protocols,
custom authentication provides the necessary control.

Enhancing your app with animations significantly improves the user experience, making it more engaging and intuitive. In FlutterFlow, you have several options to add animations to your app:

- [**Widget Animations**](widget_animations.md): Add animation effects to an entire widget.
- [**Implicit Animations**](implicit_animations.md): Animate changes in specific widget properties, such as the height of a Container.
- [**Hero Animations**](hero_animations.md): Animate a widget that transitions smoothly between screens, also known as shared element transitions.
- [**Page Transition Animations**](page_transitions.md): Specify transitions between pages within your app.
- **Import Animations**: Import animations you've created using other tools such [lottiefiles](import-animations/lottie-animation.md) and [Rive](import-animations/rive-animation.md).

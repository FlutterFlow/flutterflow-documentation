# Play / Stop Sound
The Play and Stop Sound actions allow you to enhance your app with audio effects.

## Play Sound

Using this action, you play a sound that notifies users about the action they have takenâ€”for example, playing a sound after refreshing a list or sending a message.

:::tip
It is advisable to use this action only for short audio. To play the more extended audio, consider adding the [**AudioPlayer**](audio-player.md) widget.

### Adding Play Sound [Action]

Follow the steps below to add this action to any widget.

1. Select the **Widget** (e.g., Button) on which you want to add the action.
2. Select **Actions** from the properties panel, If it's the first action, click **+ Add Action** button. Otherwise, click the "**+**" button below the previous action tile (inside *Action Flow Editor*) and select **Add Action**.
3. Search and select the **Play Sound** (under *Alerts/Notifications*) action.
4. By default, this action will be given a random **Name** so it can be stopped by the [Stop Sound](#adding-stop-sound-action) action.
5. Find the **Audio Type** dropdown and select **Network** or **Asset**.
6. If you choose *Network*:
    1. Inside the **Network Path** section,

7. If you choose *Asset,* click the **Upload Audio** button, select the sound and upload it.
8. You can also control the sound volume using the **Volume** slider. It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0 is mute and 1 is full volume.
9. By default, this action is 'non-blocking'**,** meaning it will trigger the following/next action (if any) as soon as this one is triggered. If you want to wait until the sound playing is finished before triggering any further action, enable **Await Playback** option.

There are 4 ways to test your project in FlutterFlow.

- **[Preview](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#preview-mode)**: This mode allows for quick testing of the user interface on a virtual device without requiring a full build.
- **[Test](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#test-mode)**: This mode runs a web version of your app with Flutter's "Hot Reload" feature, enabling you to visualize changes immediately.
- **[Run](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#run-mode)**: This mode allows for testing a fully functional version of your app with live data.
- **[Local Run](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/local-run.md)**: This feature, available in the FlutterFlow Desktop App, lets you test your app on an emulator or physical mobile device.

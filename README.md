# Welcome to the FlutterFlow Documentation Repository!
We're thrilled to have you here! Our documentation is a crucial resource for both new and existing users of FlutterFlow, and it grows and improves with contributions from our community. Whether you're fixing a typo, or adding a new topic, your contributions help everyone.

Below you'll find guidelines on how you can contribute to different parts of the documentation.

## A Little Note on Tooling
- Most of our documentation is written in `Markdown`, making it super easy to edit files. 
- You can choose to edit Markdown directly in GitHub or open up the entire repository in StackBlitz.

Either way, you'll need to open up a pull request and get approval from at least one code owner.

## Contribution Guidelines
Before you start contributing, please take a moment to review our [Contribution Guidelines](https://flutterflow.notion.site/Docs-Contribution-Guidelines-42829c305df441f6b061b4095abac8a8). This document outlines the process and expectations for contributions to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## How to Contribute
1. **Editing Existing Pages**:
   To make edits to an existing page in [docs.flutterflow.io](https://docs.flutterflow.io), you can use the "Edit this page" button that appears at the bottom of each page. This button will bring you straight to the source of the page in GitHub.

2. **Adding a New Docs Page**:
   To add a new docs page, simply create a new Markdown page in an existing subdirectory within the `/docs` directory.

3. **Create a PR to `main`**:
   After making these changes, commit them to a new branch, and then create a pull request (PR) for review from FlutterFlow team.

## Ready to Contribute?
Your contributions are vital to keeping FlutterFlow's documentation clear, up-to-date, and helpful. We look forward to seeing your pull requests and are excited to welcome you into our community of contributors!

If your FlutterFlow project is connected to a GitHub repository, the generated code can be pushed to GitHub, giving you full control over your projectâ€™s code. Then, you can deploy your app directly from the same repository, rather than deploying through FlutterFlow.

Deploying from GitHub is particularly beneficial when:

- You have written custom code that cannot be managed directly in FlutterFlow, such as features that require advanced Flutter functionality.
- You want to manage the source code in an external GitHub repository for better version control.
- You want to automate the process of deploying your app directly from GitHub to the Play Store or App Store after modifying the code.
- You want to deploy from a specific branch of your GitHub repository.

## Steps to Deploy

To deploy from a GitHub repository:

1. If you haven't already added your project to the GitHub repository, follow the instructions provided [here](../exporting-code/push-to-github.md#connect-a-github-repo).
2. In FlutterFlow, go to **Settings & Integrations > App Settings > Mobile Deployment.**
3. Locate the **Deployment Source** section and click the arrow icon on the right to expand it.
4. Turn on the toggle for **Use GitHub repo: [your repo URL]**.
5. Enter the branch name of your repository that contains the code you want to deploy. Ensure the branch name is correct.
6. Click the **Deploy to App Store** or **Deploy to Play Store** button, depending on your desired platform for deployment.

:::info[important]

When deploying from your GitHub branch, you will need to manage the app versioning manually. This is done through the `pubspec.yaml` file. For example, to set the version to **1.1.0** and the build number to **2**, you can use the format: `version: 1.1.0+2`.

If you are experiencing problems deploying or uploading to the Google Play Store from a Github branch, check to make sure your `build.gradle` file is correct.

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure your file has these lines of code:

    ```
    def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
    def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
    if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
        keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
    }
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    ```

3. Newer Flutterflow code will automatically have these lines added. If yours doesn't, you can push it to your `flutterflow` branch on GitHub and merge in the changes or add them like so:

    ![deploy-github-issue](../imgs/deploy-github-issue.avif)


4. Lastly, change `debug` (shown in the red box above) to `release` before deploying.

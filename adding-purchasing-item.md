# Adding & Purchasing Items

## Adding a Marketplace Item

Add new functionality to your app in seconds! The FlutterFlow Marketplace features user-built components and templates that you can add directly to your FlutterFlow project. These items allow you to add functionality that is not currently available or easy to build in FlutterFlow.

### 1. Open FlutterFlow Marketplace

To add a Marketplace Item to your project, head to your FlutterFlow dashboard and select **Marketplace** or head over to [marketplace.flutterflow.io](https://marketplace.flutterflow.io/). In Marketplace, click on any item to learn more about it.

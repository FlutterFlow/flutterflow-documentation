# FlutterFlow Marketplace Review Dispute Guidelines

At FlutterFlow Marketplace, we believe in transparent and honest feedback. Reviews are an essential part of helping buyers make informed decisions and helping creators improve their work.

However, not all reviews are created equal. Sometimes feedback is based on misunderstandings, irrelevant factors, or issues unrelated to the quality of the item itself. This guideline outlines when and how we handle review disputes.

### Criteria for Removing a Review

We may remove a review if it meets **one or more** of the following criteria:

- **Spam or Abuse:** The review contains offensive language, harassment, or unrelated spam content.
- **Misuse of the Review System:** The review is about unrelated topics (e.g., FlutterFlow features, pricing, unrelated bugs).
- **Critical Misunderstanding:** The review is based on a clear misunderstanding of the item's purpose or scope, despite the listing being accurate and transparent.
- **Irrelevant to the Current Version:** The review references issues that have since been resolved, and the creator has updated the item significantly.

:::note
We may remove outdated reviews in cases where leaving them would misrepresent the current product.

### Reviews That Meet Our Standards

We **will not remove** a review just because it is negative if it:

- Represents a real user experience
- Critiques the item's quality, usability, documentation, or performance in good faith
- Highlights friction that future buyers may encounter, even if subjective

### How to Dispute a Review

If you believe a review on your item qualifies for removal:

1. **Contact Us:** Email [marketplace@flutterflow.io](mailto:marketplace@flutterflow.io).
2. **Include:**
   - A link to the item and review
   - A short explanation of why you believe it qualifies for removal

:::info Decision
Our team will review each case individually and respond within **10 business days**.
Please note we are actively working on better creator tools to allow creators to reply directly to reviews.

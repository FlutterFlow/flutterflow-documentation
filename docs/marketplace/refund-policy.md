# Refund Policy

:::note
Please note that this policy does not override the local laws concerning refunds in your country, which remain applicable where necessary.
:::

At FlutterFlow, we're committed to ensuring that Marketplace offers high-quality templates that meet the diverse needs of our users. We understand the importance of finding the right tools to accelerate your app development, and we strive to ensure our Marketplace reflects the high standards you expect.

## No-Refund Policy

Due to the digital nature of Marketplace items, which include access to code, design, and layout, we maintain a **no-refund policy**. This policy is clearly outlined during the purchase process near the "Buy Now" button. Each template is designed for single use, and once purchased, the buyer gains immediate access to all its contents, making returns infeasible.

## Exceptional Circumstances

While our policy is to not offer refunds, we are committed to the satisfaction of our customers. If you encounter any of the following issues, you may be eligible for refund consideration:

1. **Major Defects:** All the items are thoroughly tested before being published, but unexpected errors may occur. Such issues must be submitted for verification. If any deficiency is confirmed, we will reach out to the item creator to address the issue and may issue a refund if we fail to address the defect within a reasonable time frame.
2. **Purchased with Incorrect Account:** If you purchased an item with a different account than you intended and have not yet used the item, we can help transfer the item to the correct account.

If you believe an item qualifies, please contact us directly by emailing [marketplace@flutterflow.io](mailto:marketplace@flutterflow.io). Each request will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and in exceptional circumstances, we may issue a refund. Such cases are handled manually and may take 5-10 days to process.

## Feedback and Resolution

Your feedback is vital in helping us improve the quality of the offerings on our Marketplace. If the template didnâ€™t meet your expectations, please consider:

- **Providing Feedback:** You can [rate the item](submit-feedback.md#rate-an-item) in your Marketplace dashboard, which helps us maintain quality standards and assists other users in making informed decisions.
- **Contacting the Creator:** [Reach out directly](submit-feedback.md#contact-the-item-creator) to the item creator to express any dissatisfaction.
- **Reporting Issues:** If you believe the item violates our standards or policies, please [report it](submit-feedback.md#report-an-item). We take these concerns seriously and investigate every report.

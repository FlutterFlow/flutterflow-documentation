# Submitting Feedback for Items

At FlutterFlow Marketplace, your feedback is crucial to improving the quality and reliability of the items available. There are three main ways to submit feedback:

**Via Creator's Profile:**

1. Navigate to the creator's profile on Marketplace.
2. Click the **Contact** button. This action will copy the creator's official email address to your clipboard.

2. Navigate to the **Reviews** tab.
3. Click **Add a review**.
4. Select a star rating from 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest.
5. Optionally, add a comment to your rating. Please keep your feedback respectful and honest.

**Via Dashboard:**

1. Go to the **Usage History** tab of your [dashboard](https://marketplace.flutterflow.io/dashboard).
2. Find the item you want to rate and click on the stars next to it.
3. Select a star rating from 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest.
4. Optionally, add a comment to your rating. Please keep your feedback respectful and honest.

# Enabling custom authentication [TODO / Different PR]
To enable custom authentication in FlutterFlow:
- Open Setting and Integrations > App Settings > Authentication.
- Turn on the **Enable Authentication** toggle and set Authentication Type to Custom.
- To ensure that your users are directed to the appropriate pages based on their login status, you must set the initial pages.
- By default, the **Persist Auth Sessions** option is enabled, which means users remain logged in until they actively log out. With this option enabled, your app will automatically open to the homepage whenever it's restarted.

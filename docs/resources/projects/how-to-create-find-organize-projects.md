# How to Create a Project

To create a new project, go to the Dashboard and click the “Create New” button in the upper right corner. This will open the “Create Project” window where you can choose to start with a template app or a blank project. Name the project and then select a blank project or template. 

During project creation, you can access a three-step "Project Setup" window, which is optional. If you prefer to bypass this, simply click "Skip." All setup options will remain accessible under “Settings and Integrations” → “Firebase” → Wizard hat icon.

# How to Find Projects

Navigate to the Project Dashboard to view all your projects. You can search for specific projects using the search bar. Narrow your search scope with the dropdown menu next to the search bar:

- My Private Projects: Projects accessible only to you.
- My Shared Projects: Projects you own and have shared with others.
- Shared With Me: Projects shared with you that you do not own.

### **Creating and Managing Tags**

To create a tag, click the orange “Tag” button or access it via the three dots in the upper right corner of a project panel, then select “Add Tag”. Tags help categorize and filter your projects for easier management.

### **Adding Tags to Projects**

Add a tag to a project by clicking the three dots in the upper right corner of the project panel and selecting a tag. Each project can have only one tag.

### **Searching and Filtering by Tags**

When a tag is selected, your projects list will filter to show only those projects associated with that tag. This filter can be combined with the search bar to refine your project search further.

## **Editing and Removing Tags**

Modify or remove tags by clicking the gear icon within the orange Tag button. This allows for quick updates to tag names and assignments.

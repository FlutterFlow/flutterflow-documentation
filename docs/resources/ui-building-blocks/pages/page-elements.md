# Scaffold Elements

:::info
To learn about Scaffold and the various page elements under it, refer to the [**Behind a
FlutterFlow Page**](#) section.
:::

## AppBar

**AppBar** is a widget that displays a toolbar at the top of the screen, typically used for
branding, navigation, and actions related to the current screen. It supports title and icons, 
and offers customization with a variety of styles and functionalities.

The AppBar is divided into the following sections:

- **Leading:** Typically holds a menu or back button, providing navigation control.
- **Title:** Primarily serves to indicate the content of the active screen or to display the
  name of the application, aiding users in recognizing their context within the app. This section
  can also be customized with different widgets for a more tailored visual representation.
- **Actions:** Hosts icon buttons for various operations like search, share, and more, situated on
  the right end.

### Add an AppBar to your Page

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/Gviwe4k9svWyMBr6NLCP?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Add AppBar"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

## Floating Action Button (FAB)

**Floating Action Button (FAB)** is a distinctive circular button that hovers over content, commonly
used for a primary action within an app, like adding a new item or composing a message.

### Extended Property

This variant of the `FAB` includes both an icon and a label, making it larger than the standard
circular `FAB`. It is useful when you want the action button to convey more information than just the
icon can provide, such as text explaining the action ("Add Task", "Create Post", etc.).

**Use-cases**

The **extended** `FAB` is particularly beneficial in applications where the action needs clear and
immediate recognition from the user, which cannot be fully achieved by an icon alone. It is also
useful in interfaces where there is ample space to accommodate a longer button without cluttering
the UI.

### Adding a Floating Action Button to your Page

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>

        title="Add FAB"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}

        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

## Drawers

**Drawer** is a slide-out menu that can emerge from either side of the screen, typically used for
app navigation or placing additional options. It allows users to switch between different sections
of an app without cluttering the main interface.

### Add a Drawer to your Page

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/jTl8VlxxDxmhyms7YEVS?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Scaffold - Add Drawer"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

### End-Drawer

Using a similar approach, you can also add an End Drawer to your page.

## Nav Bar

The NavBar (or Navigation Bar) allows you to quickly navigate between pages of
your app. It is displayed at the bottom of the screen for convenient access. The
items inside the NavBar are represented by an icon, optional text, or both.

You can display up to three or five primary or top-level pages (pages that can
be accessed from anywhere in your app) inside the NavBar.

From the NavBar settings page, you can add the NavBar and make modifications
such as changing the display style, reordering icons, customizing its
appearance, and more.

// TODO Image from demo app

### Enable Nav Bar in settings

By default, the NavBar is disabled for any project created in FlutterFlow.
Before you can add pages to the NavBar, you need to enable it from the
FlutterFlow settings. Navigate to **Setting and Integrations > General > NavBar & AppBar** and
enable Nav Bar.

:::caution
Initially, your NavBar will not have any pages in it. You'll see a message
instructing you to add at least two pages. Before proceeding, make sure to
create at least two pages. If you need help with adding a new page, you can find
[**more information here**](pages#creating-a-page).
:::

![nav-bar.png](..%2Fimgs%2Fnav-bar.png)

**Responsive Visibility:** To ensure that your NavBar is visible only on certain screen sizes, you
can
toggle the device icons based on your design preference.

### Add Pages to your Nav Bar

Once enabled, you need to select the pages you want to appear in the navigation
bar and then add them. Here's how you can do it:

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/ShQiuWlUfEbCT29G6nyJ?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Nav Bar Add Pages"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

#### Nav Bar Properties (Property Panel)

- **Label:** This label will be displayed on the Nav Bar.
- **Nav Bar Icon:** This icon represents the page in the Nav Bar. You can also
  choose its **size**.

:::info
Please note that the NavBar will only appear on the canvas if you have added at
least two pages to it.
:::

#### Reordering Nav Bar Items

To reorder the Nav Bar items:

- Navigate to the **Setting and Integrations > General > NavBar & AppBar > Nav Bar**.

- Under the **Re-Order Page Icons**, identify the page that you want to reorder, click on the
  hamburger
  icon (icon with three lines ) beside it and drag it in an upward or downward direction.

### Modifying NavBar Style

When you enable the NavBar, it initially adopts the Flutter Default Nav Bar
style. However, if you seek more customization options, you can set the Nav Bar
Style dropdown to one of the following:

#### Flutter Default Nav Bar

This is the standard material style NavBar. You have the option to show or hide labels for both
selected and unselected items.

## SnackBar

**SnackBar** is a temporary, lightweight notification that briefly appears at the bottom of the
screen to provide feedback about an operation.

### When to use Snackbar?

Here are some common usages of a SnackBar in an app:

- **User Feedback:** Notifies users about the success or failure of actions like submitting a
  form or uploading a file.
- **Undo Actions:** Provides a quick option to undo a recently completed action, such as deleting an
  email or removing an item from a list.
- **Informational Alerts:** Displays brief messages about changes or updates, such as
  synchronization
  status or network issues, without requiring user interaction.
- **Confirmation Messages:** Confirms the completion of tasks that don't need immediate attention,
  like saving settings or adding a calendar event.

### To show a SnackBar message

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/wSnox6aBYylpdh2qx1JJ?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Show a snackbar"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

### Show SnackBar [Action]

Material Design allows you to add an interactive element to the SnackBar
notification, allowing users to respond directly from the snack message.


#### Add Action Property

Typically, a SnackBar can include a single action button. This button is
used to offer users an immediate option to interact with the snack message.

Common uses include undoing an action that the snack message refers to (like undoing a deletion),
retrying a failed task (like reconnecting to a network), or any other quick recovery or response
tasks.

- **Customization:** The action within a SnackBar is customizable. You can define the button's
label, appearance, and the function it executes when pressed. This allows the SnackBar to not only
inform users but also engage them in meaningful ways to enhance the user experience.

- **Timeouts and Visibility:** The presence of an action can affect the duration the SnackBar is
displayed. By default, a SnackBar may auto-dismiss after a few seconds, but if an action button is
present, users might need more time to read the message and respond, thus you might consider
adjusting the display duration accordingly.

![snackbar-action-props.png](..%2Fimgs%2Fsnackbar-action-props.png)

Adding actions to SnackBars helps make them not just informative but also interactive, facilitating
a more dynamic user interaction model where feedback and actions are closely linked.

![snackbar.png](..%2Fimgs%2Fsnackbar.png)

### Hide SnackBar [Action]

Managing multiple SnackBar instances efficiently is crucial because showing them all at once can
overwhelm the user interface and confuse the user. To address this, Flutter apps uses a queuing
system for `SnackBars`:

**Snackbar Queue:** When multiple SnackBars are triggered in succession, they are queued to be
displayed one after the other rather than all at once. Each `SnackBar` waits for the previous one to
disappear before the next one shows up.

**Hiding Previous Snackbar:** If you want to immediately replace a currently displayed SnackBar with
a new one without waiting for it to auto-dismiss, you can use the **Hide Snackbar** action in
FlutterFlow.

The action has the following hide scope:

- **Current Only:** This option hides only the currently displayed snackbar.
- **All (Current and Queue):** This option hides the current snackbar as well as any snackbar in the
  queue.

This can be useful in scenarios where an immediate update to the user feedback is necessary, such
as correcting a message or providing new information. By using these methods, you can control the
flow of information via SnackBars, ensuring that user feedback is timely, relevant, and not
overwhelming.

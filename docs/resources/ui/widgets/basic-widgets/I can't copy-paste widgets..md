# Unable to Copy and Paste Widgets in FlutterFlow

If you're unable to copy and paste widgets, it's likely due to your browser's clipboard permissions.

## How to Fix It

Make sure **Clipboard access** is allowed for FlutterFlow in your browser. If you're using Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Click the **lock icon** next to the website address in the browser's address bar.
2. A popup will appear. Set **Clipboard** permissions to **Allow**.

After adjusting the permissions, try copy-pasting the widget again.

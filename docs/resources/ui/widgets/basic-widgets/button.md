# Button 
The Button widget is a fundamental component in user interface design, utilized extensively across web and mobile applications. It serves as a primary means of user interaction, allowing users to execute actions or commands within an application. Buttons are essential for:

- **Initiating Actions:** Whether it's submitting a form, opening a new page, or performing any 
operational task, buttons trigger these functionalities.

- **User Feedback:** Buttons often change visually in response to user actions—like hover effects, 
changes in color on click, or disabled states—providing immediate visual feedback that confirms an action has been recognized.

- **Navigational Purposes:** Buttons can guide users through a site or application, such as moving to 
the next page of a form or returning to the home page.

- **Enhancing User Experience:** Well-designed buttons are crucial for creating a smooth and 
intuitive user experience. They are designed to be easily recognizable and accessible, facilitating a seamless interaction by clearly communicating their function.

When you add a Button widget to your Page or Component and select it, the Properties Panel on the right displays various properties and functionalities:

Some significant properties are illustrated below:

### Button Default Styling Settings

Define the initial appearance of your button, including its size, color, border, and padding. 
These settings determine how the button looks under default conditions.

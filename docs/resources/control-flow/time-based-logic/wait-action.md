# Wait [Action]

**"Waiting"** on an action or function is a fundamental concept in time-based logic, allowing developers to introduce intentional pauses within a sequence of actions. This is also known as delaying execution of logic, where the execution of a sequence of actions is paused for a specified period. This action is particularly useful when there is a need to synchronize events, manage the timing of operations, or ensure that certain conditions are met before proceeding further in a workflow.

## Delayed Execution of Logic
Delaying execution of logic involves pausing the execution of a sequence of actions for a specified period. This is useful when you need to introduce a time delay before proceeding to the next step in a workflow or process.

## Use-cases

- When you need to wait for a certain condition to be met (e.g., waiting for data to load or a 
user to complete an action).
- To create pauses between actions for better user experience (e.g., displaying messages 
  sequentially).
- Waiting before performing an animation. 

## How to?

To implement a Wait Action in your Action Flows, follow this simple tutorial: 

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/ou0tecrBVViOqy74U9nE?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title=""
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

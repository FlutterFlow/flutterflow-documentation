# Wait [Action]

The **Wait** action is used to pause the execution of a workflow for a specific amount of time. This is helpful when you want to delay the next step in a sequence, for example, to synchronize events, allow animations to complete, or ensure a condition is met before continuing. Itâ€™s a key concept in managing time-based logic within action flows.

:::tip[Possible use cases]
- **Show Splash Screen:** Delay the transition to the next page to allow the splash screen to be visible for a few seconds.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Introduce timed delays between steps to guide users through a tutorial or onboarding flow.
- **Chain Animations:** Add pauses between multiple animations for a more fluid and organized visual effect.

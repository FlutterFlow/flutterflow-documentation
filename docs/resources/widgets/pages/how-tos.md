FlutterFlow allows you to easily create new pages using the Page Selector
button, which is available in the Widget Tree menu (Tab+2). This will help you
quickly start and add new pages to your app.

## Create an empty page

To create an empty FlutterFlow page from scratch, follow the steps:

<iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/rtOPRXVUByUAXxUynd8T?embed&show_copy_link=true" title="app.flutterflow.io/authentication" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen allow="clipboard-write" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

## Create a page from a popular template

FlutterFlow simplifies the process of page creation by offering a variety of
popular template use cases. These templates provide a basic structure for your
pages, which you can quickly customize with your own styling, widgets, and text.

To utilize a template from FlutterFlow, follow these steps:

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/bkaz68ipgi497Pf4v8EB?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Create a page from a popular template"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>


## Create an AI generated page

FlutterFlow's 'AI Gen' feature allows you to generate various elements,
including pages, from a prompt. This can be particularly useful when you're
unsure where to start.

Once the page is generated, you can preview it with different color schemes, in
both light and dark themes, and add new themes as desired. You also have the
option to view the page's code and regenerate images as needed.

To create an AI Generated page, follow the steps:

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/hLpE44TVjb72rzTTpxRK?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Create an AI generated page"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>

In FlutterFlow, setting page properties is an essential step to customizing the
behavior and appearance of your app’s pages. Here’s an overview of how you can
set and manage
these properties in FlutterFlow:

## Modifying Page Properties

To access and modify page properties in FlutterFlow, you navigate to the page
you want to edit, click on the Scaffold widget (the first widget in the widget tree) and look for the page properties panel on the right.

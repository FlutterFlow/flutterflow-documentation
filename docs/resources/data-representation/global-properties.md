# Global Properties

Global properties are **built-in variable**s in FlutterFlow that you can use across all pages of your app. These properties are predefined by FlutterFlow, meaning you cannot create or modify them yourself. They are designed to help you perform common tasks efficiently, no matter what type of app youâ€™re developing.

For example, global properties can be used to redirect users to another page if they are not logged in or to enable specific functionality based on the platform your app is running on.

You can access these properties through the **Set from Variable** menu **> Global Properties**.

# Dashboard
When you log in to FlutterFlow, the first thing you’ll encounter is the **Dashboard**. It serves as a central hub for managing your projects, including creating new ones, searching, deleting, and duplicating projects. Additionally, the Dashboard lets you choose your preferred theme—**dark or light**—for a more comfortable viewing experience.

The Dashboard provides convenient access to organizational resources, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members. Additionally, it integrates with a marketplace where users can browse and download widgets, templates, and plugins.

You can also find links to various resources to assist in building apps with FlutterFlow. Your account information and plan details are easily accessible from this page as well.

- **Projects**: This section displays the projects you have created in FlutterFlow. You can easily navigate to any of them from here. Use the overflow menu to rename, duplicate, delete, leave the project, add tags, and open the project in a new browser tab.

    :::info
    When you duplicate a project containing the Firebase setup, you must delete the config files in your duplicated project and initiate a new [**Firebase setup**](../../ff-integrations/firebase/connect-to-firebase-setup.md) for your project.

- **Dark/Light mode switch**: The Dark/Light mode switch allows you to choose between a light and dark color scheme for our app builder.

- **Search**: From here, you can search for your project.

- **Filter projects**: You can use this dropdown menu to filter your projects based on their privacy settings. You can filter projects that are marked as private, shared by you, or shared with you.

- **Tag project**: From here, you can create and add a tag to projects, providing a quick and organized way to classify and identify projects based on their characteristics, purpose, or status.

    To tag a project, simply click the three dots option menu on the project tile, select **Add Tag,** and then click on the tag you want to set. Later, you can search and filter the projects based on the tags.

# Dashboard
When you log in to FlutterFlow, the first thing you’ll encounter is the **Dashboard**. It serves as a central hub for managing your projects, including creating new ones, searching, deleting, and duplicating projects. Additionally, the Dashboard lets you choose your preferred theme—**dark or light**—for a more comfortable viewing experience.

The Dashboard provides convenient access to organizational resources, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members. Additionally, it integrates with a marketplace where users can browse and download widgets, templates, and plugins.

You can also find links to various resources to assist in building apps with FlutterFlow. Your account information and plan details are easily accessible from this page as well.

- **Projects**: Projects section displays all the projects you have created in FlutterFlow. Use the overflow menu to rename, duplicate, delete, leave the project, add tags, and open the project in a new browser tab.

    :::info
    When you duplicate a project containing the Firebase setup, you must delete the config files in your duplicated project and initiate a new [**Firebase setup**](../../ff-integrations/firebase/connect-to-firebase-setup.md) for your project.

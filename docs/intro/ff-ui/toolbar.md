## AI Tools
FlutterFlow AI Tools is a powerful set of features designed to speed up app development by leveraging artificial intelligence. These tools allow you to quickly generate app elements such as pages, components, and even entire page layouts with relevant widgets automatically populated.

### New Page Creation
Instantly create pages in your app from a prompt. To create a page, open the **AI Tools** menu from the Toolbar. Next, select **New Page Creation** and enter a description for your page.

    <div style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: 'calc(50.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
        height: 0,
        width: '100%'}}>
        <iframe 
            src="https://demo.arcade.software/jAH6Ar0X8fTIk3PTRNej?embed&show_copy_link=true"
            title=""
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
                colorScheme: 'light'
            }}
            frameborder="0"
            loading="lazy"
            webkitAllowFullScreen
            mozAllowFullScreen
            allowFullScreen
            allow="clipboard-write">
        </iframe>
    </div>
    <p></p>

### New Component Creation
Aside from pages, you can also create [Components](/resources/ui/components) directly from a prompt. To create a component, open the **AI Tools** menu from the Toolbar. Next, select **New Component Creation** and enter a description for your UI component.

    <div style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: 'calc(50.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
        height: 0,
        width: '100%'}}>
        <iframe 
            src="https://demo.arcade.software/qTqZVHv7EOjw0Gcfp697?embed&show_copy_link=true"
            title=""
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
                colorScheme: 'light'
            }}
            frameborder="0"
            loading="lazy"
            webkitAllowFullScreen
            mozAllowFullScreen
            allowFullScreen
            allow="clipboard-write">
        </iframe>
    </div>
    <p></p>

### Sketch To Component
Sketch to Component allows you to add a sketch of your [Component](/resources/ui/components). This sketch can include outlines of widgets or layouts to incorporate, and it can also include annotations that tell the AI tool more about the design you have in mind. 

To create a Component from a sketch, open the **AI Tools** menu from the Toolbar. Next, select **Sketch to Component** and draw directly in the input or upload an image file of your sketch.

    <div style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
        height: 0,
        width: '100%'}}>

    </div>
    <p></p>

### Page Autocomplete
Page Autocomplete intelligently adds relevant widgets to a page based on the pages’s context, making it easy to complete partially built pages.
The project context includes the existing widgets and design of those widgets, as well as the page's description. 

If the page does not have a description, you will be asked to describe what you want the page to contain. 

To use Page Autocomplete, open the **AI Tools** menu from the Toolbar. Next, and select **Page Autocomplete** on the page that
you want FlutterFlow AI to complete.

    <div style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
        height: 0,
        width: '100%'}}>

    </div>
    <p></p>

## Canvas size

We allow you to visualize and design your app for various mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The [canvas](../ff-ui/canvas.md) size is defined as width (in pixels) x height (in pixels). This size is determined according to the device selected. To set a custom canvas size, click on the Canvas Size and enter the width and height (in pixels) you want.

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'

## Project history

Understand the crucial concepts of project history, such as saving and versioning [here](../../testing-deployment-publishing/branching-collaboration/saving-versioning.md).

## Project comments

This helps you leave your thoughts, opinions, questions, or feedback on a specific widget with your project team or a client. While adding a comment, you can tag users, and they will be able to respond, creating a thread of conversation.

:::info

To tag users, select the @ symbol and choose the project team member(s).

:::

## Optimizations & Enhancements

We scan and suggest enhancements to elevate your app's design and speed. Imagine having a personal consultant for design and performance dedicated to improving the user experience of your app.

**Optimizations**: We spotlight elements that may slow down your app. For example, a query on a column, unused and duplicate backend query, a widget with unbounded size, etc.

**UI Enhancements**: We offer tips for a more visually appealing and user-friendly design, like resizing a small tap target of any widget.

:::info

You can control what kind of suggestions you would like to receive by clicking on the settings icon on the right.

## Project issues

If there are any issues or warnings present in your current project that might result in a build failure or app crash, they will be displayed in this section. You can click this option to view a short description of each issue and navigate to the place where you can fix the issue by clicking on the respective issue.

:::tip[Errors vs Warnings]
**Errors** prevent your app from compiling and running. These must be resolved in order to run the app. They can be due to missing actions, errors in custom code, incorrect data types, and so on.

**Warnings** while not preventing compilation, indicate potential issues such as incorrect rules setup or performance problems. Although it's possible to ignore warnings, addressing them can enhance the quality of your app and prevent future issues.

## Branching

[Branching](../../testing-deployment-publishing/branching-collaboration/branching.md) enables you to create a separate copy of your existing project, allowing you to develop new features without affecting the current functionality.

## Developer menu
The Developer Menu provides developers with access to tools such as code viewing, GitHub integration, and source code download capabilities.

1. **View Code**: This option lets you display the *Dart* code for all the pages of your FlutterFlow project. You can also take a look at the dependencies being used by the app here.

2. **Connect GitHub Repo**: You can use this option to connect and upload your project to [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. See the step-by-step guide [here](../../testing-deployment-publishing/exporting-code/push-to-github.md#connect-a-github-repo).

3. **Download Code**: You can download the entire codebase of the app generated by FlutterFlow using this option.

4. **Download APK**: Use this to generate a release build of your Android app. It will automatically download the `.apk` file after the building process is complete.

5. **FlutterFlow CLI**: You can also download the code using *[FlutterFlow CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterflow_cli)*. See instructions [here](../../testing-deployment-publishing/exporting-code/ff-cli.md).

:::note
_Connect GitHub Repo_, _Download Code_, and _Download APK_ features requires a [**paid plan**](https://flutterflow.io/pricing).
:::

6. **Open in VSCode**: This option lets you open your entire FlutterFlow project in a VS Code environment, offering a richer development experience. You’ll have real-time autocomplete and error detection, easier access to existing Flutter & Dart tooling, and the ability to leverage the AI ecosystem.

## Share project

You can make a project public so that others can view and clone your project. Before you share your project, make sure to remove any sensitive information.

:::note

- You can only share projects where you are the owner.
- The share feature can be used to create Marketplace items. You can learn more about this [here](../../marketplace/index.md).

:::

## Preview

You can use this option to run your app in [Preview mode](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#preview-mode).

## Testing

This menu allows you to run your app in [Test](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#test-mode) or [Run](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/run-your-app.md#run-mode) mode.

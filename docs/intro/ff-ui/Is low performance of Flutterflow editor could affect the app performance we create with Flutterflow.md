# Does FlutterFlow Editor Performance Affect the Final App?

When using a drag-and-drop interface like FlutterFlow to build applications, a significant amount of code is generated behind the scenes. This sometimes raises concerns: _Does sluggish performance in the FlutterFlow editor impact the app's actual performance?_

The short answer: **No, it does not.**

## Understanding the Difference

The performance of the **FlutterFlow editor** is separate from the performance of the **final app**. Just because the editor might be slow on your machine doesn’t mean your app will be slow when built and deployed.

### Analogy

> Think of it like using a photo editor. If Adobe Photoshop runs slowly on your computer, it doesn’t make your exported images blurry — the tool’s speed doesn’t affect the quality of the output.

The same concept applies here. The generated Flutter code may be extensive, but it compiles down efficiently and runs independently of the development environment.

## Known Editor Performance Factors

Some aspects of the FlutterFlow editor may contribute to slower experience:

### 1. **Typing Long Texts**

Typing directly into large text fields in FlutterFlow can cause CPU spikes because every keystroke triggers real-time updates.  
**Recommendation**: Draft long text in an external editor and paste it into FlutterFlow.

### 2. **Large Projects**

Projects with many pages, components, or text fields may consume more memory and perform slower in the browser.

### 3. **Browser Cache Limitations**

Working in FlutterFlow for extended periods without restarting your browser can lead to performance degradation due to cache limits.

## Optimization Tips

- Use the **macOS desktop app** version of FlutterFlow when working mostly on UI.
- Periodically **restart or hard-refresh** your browser to clear temporary data.
- Consider breaking very large projects into modular parts if needed.

## Final Thoughts

Despite minor editor slowdowns, FlutterFlow is a robust platform for building performant, real-world apps. To validate performance, simply build your app and run it on a real device — most users experience great results.

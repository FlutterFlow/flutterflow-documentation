# Roadmap

This roadmap guides you through the key layers of app development: the **UI Layer, Logic Layer,** and **Data Layer**. Understanding these layers is essential for creating apps that are visually appealing, functionally robust, and secure. 


![layers.avif](layers.avif)

## UI Layer
- **FlutterFlow Widgets:**
  - [Atomic Design](../resources/ui/overview.md)
  - [Pages](../resources/ui/pages/intro-pages.md), [Widget](../resources/ui/widgets/intro-widgets.md) & [Components](../resources/ui/components/intro-components.md)
- **Navigation:**
  - Page Transitions (Slide, Fade, etc.)
  - AppBar and Navigation Bars
  - Bottom Navigation, Drawer Navigation
- **User Experience (UX):**
  - UI Customization (Themes, Colors, Fonts)
  - Responsive Design Elements
  - Interaction Feedback (Hover effects, Click animations)
         
## Logic Layer
   
- **State Management:**
   Handling State Variables in FlutterFlow (e.g., Boolean, Integer, String variables)
   Managing Widget States (Visibility, Enabled/Disabled states)
   Dynamic Lists (Generating Dynamic Children)
- **Business Logic:**
   Conditional Actions (If-Else logic)
   Custom Functions (Using Dart Code in FlutterFlow)
   Form Validation Logic
   
- **Navigation Logic:**
   Conditional Navigation (Based on user inputs, data)
   In-App Routing (Deep Links, Conditional Page Routing)
   Notification Logic:
   Triggering Push Notifications
   In-App Notifications and Alerts
   Handling Notification Preferences

## Data Layer
   
- **Data Management:**
   Integrations with Databases (Firebase, REST APIs)
   Local Storage (Using Shared Preferences, Local DBs)
   Data Binding to Widgets (Real-time updates, Fetch & Display)
   
- **API Integration:**
   Calling External APIs (Using HTTP Requests in FlutterFlow)
   Handling API Responses (Parsing JSON, Error Handling)
   Caching Data (Local caching mechanisms)
   
- **Authentication & Security:**
   User Authentication (Firebase Auth, OAuth)
   Role-Based Access Control (Managing User Roles)
   Data Encryption and Secure Storage
   Analytics and Performance:
   Logging Events (Firebase Analytics, Custom Events)
   Monitoring Performance (App Load Times, API Response Times)
   Error Tracking (Using Sentry, Crashlytics)

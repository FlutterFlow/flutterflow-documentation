# App Development

Before you jump in and start using FlutterFlow, it's helpful to have an idea of how app development works more broadly. 

Traditionally, developing an app required writing a lot of code. You can think of code as a set of instructions for the computer, or device, executing the code. 

The codebase is usually divided up into two pieces: instructions for the frontend, and instructions for the backend. 

# Frontend vs Backend

Frontend development deals with creating the parts of an application that users interact with directly. 
This includes:

- Defining the visual pieces of your app, like text or buttons
- Figuring out how these pieces should be laid out on the screen
- Setting up logic for how your app should react to retrieved data and user interactions

Backend usually refers to more complex logic and data storage. This includes:

- Setting up a database that is capabale of storing, sending and retrieving data
- Leveraging off-the-shelf services, like authentication providers or payment platforms
- Defining business logic, either by writing code or using a low-code tool


The interaction between frontend and backend often occurs through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
In most cases, the backend exposes endpoints for the frontend to send requests to. 
The backend handles the request, and sends some data back in response - which the frontend can use to change its visual appearance. 


# Where does the code execute?

Backend code runs on a server

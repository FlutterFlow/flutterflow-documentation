# Create an account

Create your free account to get started with FlutterFlow. After you've set up your account, you'll be able to create as many projects as you like.

You can [**sign up**](https://app.flutterflow.io/create-account) via Apple, Google, or Github.

## System Requirements

The FlutterFlow application can be accessed from your browser or installed as a desktop app.

### General recommendations:
- Use a screen that is at least **1280 x 1024** 

### Browser recommendations:
- FlutterFlow works best on **Google Chrome** 
- We recommend keeping your browser up-to-date, specifically within the latest two versions
- You should allow pop-up and redirects and ClipBoard from _app.flutterflow.io_.

### Desktop recommendations:
- **macOS**: While FlutterFlow should work on 10.13 or higher, we recommend using 13 or higher
- **Windows**: While FlutterFlow should work on 7 or higher, we recommend using 10 or higher

For details on target platform system requirements, please see the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms).

### Desktop vs Web:
We recommend using the desktop application for improved performance and access to features like [**local run**](../../testing-deployment-publishing/running-your-app/local-run.md). 

However, our desktop applications are currently in a preview phase, which may result in some instability.

# Import Modified Source Code into FlutterFlow

FlutterFlow currently **does not support** importing source code that has been manually modified in external IDEs such as Android Studio or VS Code back into the FlutterFlow visual builder.

:::note
You can run modified source code from GitHub in **Test Mode**, but these changes cannot be synced back into the FlutterFlow UI editor.
:::

## Recommended Workflow

If you plan to make significant custom code changes, it’s best to manage those changes **outside of FlutterFlow**. Treat FlutterFlow as your starting point or prototyping tool, and use an external IDE for advanced customizations.

---

> ⚠️ Once you export and modify the code externally, any updates made in FlutterFlow cannot be merged or reflected in the modified code automatically.

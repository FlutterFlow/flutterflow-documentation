# Upgrading FlutterFlow Account from Pro to Teams

If you're looking to collaborate on your FlutterFlow projects with other team members, upgrading your account from Pro to Teams is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to upgrade your account and select the number of seats for your team.

How to Upgrade Your Existing Pro Account to a Teams Account

**Note: **the person who takes steps to upgrade from Pro to Teams will become the team owner. The owner is able to set permissions, manage billing, and more. 

Step 1: Navigate to My Organization

Begin by logging into your FlutterFlow account.

On the left-hand side of your dashboard, you will find the **My Organization** section. Click on it to proceed.

Step 2: Create a Team

Inside the **My Organization** section, look for the **Create Team** option. If you haven't already set up a team, this is where you'll need to start.

Click on **Create Team** and follow the prompts to set up your new team. This process will include naming your team and potentially inviting members at a later stage.

Step 3: Subscribe to a Teams Account

Once your team is set up, you'll find the option to **Subscribe** within the same **My Organization** section.

Click on **Subscribe** to begin the upgrade process from your current Pro account to a Teams account.

Step 4: Select the Number of Seats

During the subscription process, you will be prompted to select the number of seats you require for your team.

The number of seats corresponds to the number of team members you can have in your FlutterFlow team. Choose the number that best fits your current needs. Remember, you can always add more seats later if your team grows.

Step 5: Complete Your Upgrade

After selecting the number of seats, follow the remaining on-screen instructions to complete your upgrade. This will likely involve confirming your team details and completing the payment for the Teams subscription.

Note:

Upgrading to a Teams account provides you with additional collaboration features that are not available in the Pro account. It's designed to enhance your team's productivity and streamline your FlutterFlow project development.

For any further assistance or questions regarding your account upgrade, please reach out to the FlutterFlow support team.

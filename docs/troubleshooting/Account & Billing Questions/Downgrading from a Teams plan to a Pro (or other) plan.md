# Downgrading from a Teams plan to a Pro (or other) plan

The best way to downgrade from a Teams plan to a different plan is to let your current subscription expire. You can cancel your account to initiate this process. 

To cancel your account, click on your name in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen on app.flutterflow.io.

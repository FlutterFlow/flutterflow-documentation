# Fix Java Runtime Missing Error

This error typically occurs when Java is not installed or configured properly on your system:

    ```text
    The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
    ```

    To resolve this, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) appropriate for your operating system.

    1. Go to the **[official Java download page](https://www.java.com/en/download/)**.
    2. Select your operating system and download the Java installer.
    3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    4. Restart your computer after installation.

:::tip
On **macOS**, if you continue to see this error, open **System Preferences > Java** to verify the installation, or run `java -version` in your terminal to confirm it's available.

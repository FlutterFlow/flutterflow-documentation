# Run Mode: Build Failure

Encountering a "Run mode: Build failed" error can be frustrating when you're eager to see your app in action. This error typically signifies a project issue that prevents a successful build. Addressing these errors promptly ensures your app's functionality and performance. 

This guide provides a structured approach to troubleshooting and resolving "Run mode: Build failed" errors, ensuring a smooth development process for your projects.

- **Recognizing the Error**

    Here's what the "Run mode: Build failed" error looks like inside of FlutterFlow:

- **Understanding Test Mode vs. Run Mode**

    Here's a little background on run mode vs. test mode in FlutterFlow. Test mode runs as a "test" to help you identify errors before deployment. These features include a debugger and display warnings. Alternatively, run mode attempts to run the app in **release mode** to better mimic what your users can expect in production. In release mode, **warnings are mostly suppressed**, meaning it's important to ensure you are acknowledging and addressing warnings in debug mode before you enter run mode.

    The "Run mode: Build failed" error can occur under various circumstances, during:

        - Run mode

        - APK download

        - Code download

        - GitHub push

        - And more

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

- **Custom Code Failures**

    - **Issue**: Your project's custom code doesn't show errors within the editor, but errors appear when you try to run the app.

    - **Example**: A custom widget lacks web support.

    - **Solution**: Verify on pub.dev or equivalent platforms that the custom code supports the necessary platforms (example, web, iOS, Android).

    - **Best practice**: Consider running the code locally on a sample Flutter project before implementing the custom code inside FlutterFlow to identify possible errors logged.

- **Widget Failures**

    - **Issue**: A widget within your app causes the build to fail due to errors.

    - **Example**: Actions assigned to a widget are incomplete or improperly configured.

    - **Solution**: Locate the error-causing widget (usually identified in the error message)

        To correct the issue:

            - Ensure the widget tree is correctly formatted

            - Verify that widgets are named clearly for easy identification

- **Build Fails Without Error Messages**

    - **Issue**: The build process fails without displaying an error message, making it challenging to diagnose the problem.

    - **Solution**: Download and run the project code locally with a debugger to identify and resolve the issue. If downloading the code is problematic, check your browser's console for errors that might indicate the cause.

- **Grey Screen in Run Mode**

    - **Issue**: Encountering a grey screen in run mode usually indicates an error suppressed by the release mode.

    - **Solution**: Run the app in test mode to potentially reveal the error for troubleshooting. If test mode does not display errors, use the browser's developer console for clues.

## Checklist for Troubleshooting

- **Identify when and where the error occurs**: 

    Determine if the error is specific to run mode, test mode, or other instances like APK download or code download.

- **Locate the source of the error**: 

    The error message often provides clues about where the problem lies, whether in custom code, a specific widget, or elsewhere.

- **Check for platform support**:

    For issues related to custom code, ensure compatibility with your target platforms.

- **Examine widget configuration**: 

    Verify that all actions and configurations associated with widgets are complete and correct.

- **Utilize local debugging**: 

    If the error is elusive, running the debugger locally on your downloaded code can help identify the issue.
    
- **Leverage browser tools**: 

    The browser's console and developer tools can offer insights, especially when dealing with errors that don't manifest in traditional debug outputs.

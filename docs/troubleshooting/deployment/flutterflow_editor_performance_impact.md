# Understand the Impact of Editor Performance on App Builds

When developing applications using FlutterFlow, the editor may occasionally experience slow performance, especially when working with large projects. However, this does not affect the performance of the final app build.

## Editor Performance vs. App Performance

   FlutterFlow uses a visual interface to generate clean and structured Dart code in the background. While some users may experience delays or UI lag in the FlutterFlow editor, especially when working on complex projects, these editor-side issues do not impact the compiled app’s runtime behavior or performance.

   A helpful analogy is graphic design software: if Adobe Photoshop runs slowly on your computer, it doesn’t make the images blurry. Similarly, FlutterFlow editor lag does not degrade the quality or speed of the app it produces.

## Common Causes of Editor Slowness

   :::info[Editor Performance Factors]
   The following conditions may lead to lag in the FlutterFlow editor:
   :::

   - Large projects with many pages, widgets, or custom functions.
   - Excessive use of long text fields directly inside the editor.
   - Browsers accumulating cache over long work sessions without restarts.

:::tip[Tips to Improve Editor Responsiveness]
To ensure smoother performance while using the FlutterFlow editor:

1. **Avoid Typing Long Text Blocks Directly**  
   Write and format long content in a separate text editor, then copy it into FlutterFlow.

2. **Restart Your Browser Regularly**  
   Refresh or relaunch the browser periodically to clear memory and cache.

3. **Use macOS App for UI Workflows**  
   The macOS version of FlutterFlow is optimized for better performance when building UI components.

4. **Close Unused Pages and Widgets**  
   Reducing the number of open tabs and components can free up memory.
:::

Any lag or slowness in the FlutterFlow editor is limited to the development environment. The compiled app’s performance depends on:
   - The efficiency of the generated Flutter code.
   - App logic, API usage, image sizes, and animation complexity.
   - Device resources and internet connectivity.

   Apps built with FlutterFlow run on Flutter’s framework, which is known for its speed and reliability in production environments.

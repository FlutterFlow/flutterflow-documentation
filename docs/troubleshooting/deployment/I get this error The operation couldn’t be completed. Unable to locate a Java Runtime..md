# I get this error: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.

This error means your system does not have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed or it cannot be located.

## How to Fix It

To resolve the issue:

1. Visit the official Java website: [https://www.java.com](https://www.java.com)
2. Download the latest version of Java for your operating system.
3. Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
4. Restart your computer if needed and try running the operation again.

If you're using macOS and still see the error, you may need to install a specific version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle's JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

> ğŸ’¡ Ensure that Java is added to your systemâ€™s PATH if you continue encountering issues.

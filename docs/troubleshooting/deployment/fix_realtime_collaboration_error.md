When attempting to access a project within an organization, you may encounter an error preventing project collaboration.

This message appears when the project has not been shared with the organization, making it inaccessible to other collaborators.

:::info[Prerequisites]

Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

   1. **Open the Project in FlutterFlow**  
      Navigate to the project where the error occurs.

   2. **Go to Collaboration Settings**  
      Open the **Settings > Collaboration** tab from the left navigation panel.

   3. **Enable Organization Sharing**  
      Toggle the **Share with my organization** option.

   Once these steps are completed, all members of your organization will be able to access and collaborate on the project simultaneously in real-time.

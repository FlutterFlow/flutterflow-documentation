# Enable Windows Platform

You can enable Windows support in your FlutterFlow project to generate apps compatible with the Windows operating system. This setting is available in the **Platforms** section of your project configuration.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- A FlutterFlow project already created.
- Desktop development enabled in your Flutter environment (when exporting code).
:::

:::note
Windows support is currently in **alpha** and may not work as expected, particularly on older versions of Windows.
:::

Follow the steps below to enable windows platform:

    1. Open your FlutterFlow project.
    2. From the left-hand navigation menu, select **Settings and Integrations**.
    3. Under the **Project Setup** section, click on **Platforms**.

    Once enabled, your project will generate Windows-compatible source code when exporting.


Enabling Windows support in FlutterFlow allows you to generate desktop apps for the Windows platform. Although currently in alpha, this feature can help you prototype and test desktop builds directly from FlutterFlow.

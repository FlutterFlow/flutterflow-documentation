## üß† Why You Are Seeing This Error

There is a limit to how many **custom subdomains** you can publish under the `flutterflow.app` domain:

- **Free plan:** up to **3 subdomains**
- **Paid plan:** up to **10 subdomains**

> **Note:** Only *custom* subdomains count toward this quota. If your subdomain uses the **project ID**, it does **not** count.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### 1. Change the Subdomain Name to Your Project ID

Use your **project ID** as the subdomain name (set in the ‚ÄúSite URL‚Äù field). This avoids counting against your quota.

### 2. Unpublish Other Projects

If you've reached your subdomain quota, unpublish some of your existing projects:

1. Go to **Web Publishing**
2. Click the **Unpublish** button on older projects.

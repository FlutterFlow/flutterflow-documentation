# Firebase Push Notifications on Web

FlutterFlow currently does not support sending Firebase push notifications on web apps natively. However, Firebase itself supports this capability. This guide outlines alternative approaches to enable Firebase push notifications on web projects built with FlutterFlow.

## Workarounds for Implementing Web Push Notifications

There are two primary methods to implement Firebase web push notifications in FlutterFlow projects:

- **Use Custom Actions:**

    - Create custom actions in FlutterFlow that utilize Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications.
    - This method requires writing custom code to handle notification logic and integrate it into FlutterFlow.
    - Custom actions offer flexibility for handling different types of notifications based on the appâ€™s needs.
    - The Firebase Web SDK can be used alongside your FlutterFlow project to achieve this.

    Refer to official Firebase documentation for detailed steps on **[setting up web push notifications](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client)**.


- **Use Back-End Functions:**

    - Implement server-side code using Firebase Functions or any other backend service.
    - Backend functions handle sending notifications independently of the FlutterFlow frontend.
    - This approach allows using the Firebase Admin SDK to programmatically send push notifications to targeted web clients.
    - Backend solutions also offer better scalability, error handling, and control over notification delivery.

:::note
- Web push notification support requires properly configured Firebase Cloud Messaging, service workers, and valid VAPID keys.
- FlutterFlow may add native support for web push notifications in future updates as the platform evolves.

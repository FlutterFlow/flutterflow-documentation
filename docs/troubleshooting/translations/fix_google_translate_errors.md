# Fix Google Translate Errors

FlutterFlow integrates with Google Translate to help localize your app automatically. This guide outlines how to identify and resolve common issues with the translation integration.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- Google Translate integration has been added to the project.
- At least one supported language has been configured under **App Settings > Localization**.
- Refer to the **[Google Translate Integration](/concepts/localization/#add-multi-language-support)** guide.
:::

## Common Translation Issues:

   - **Long Text Blocks:** Exceeding limits or timeouts â€” translate externally if needed.  
   - **Unsupported Characters:** Emojis or symbols may cause errors. Remove or replace.  
   - **Language Limits:** Max 10 languages supported. Reduce if necessary.  

## Steps to Troubleshoot Translation Failures:

1. **Locate the Problem Area**  
   Identify whether the error occurs on a specific widget, page, or text field to narrow down the source of the issue.

2. **Check the Browser Console**  
   Use Chrome DevTools to inspect the console for errors related to failed translation requests.

3. **Use the Translate All Button**  
   Clicking **Translate All** will begin the process and stop at the first problematic field, helping you identify where the issue occurs.

4. **Temporarily Remove Problem Text**  
   If a specific field is causing an issue, delete the content, run the translation process, and then re-add the translated content manually.

:::tip

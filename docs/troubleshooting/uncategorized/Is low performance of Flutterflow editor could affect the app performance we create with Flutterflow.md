# Is low performance of Flutterflow editor could affect the app performance we create with Flutterflow?

When working with a drag-and-drop interface to develop a code-based application, a considerable amount of code is generated in the background. Flutterflow is a popular low-code platform that uses a drag-and-drop interface to simplify app development, and some users may have concerns about the potential impact of the generated code on their app's performance.​

However, it's important to note that any sluggishness experienced when working with Flutterflow does not necessarily impact the app's performance. Users may worry that the large amount of code generated in the background may slow their apps down, but this is not the case.
For instance, if someone complains that Adobe Photoshop is slow on their computer, they may worry that this could cause their images to become blurry. However, this isn't a direct correlation - using Photoshop doesn't inherently make images blurry, and it's not slow for everyone.​

The same concept applies to Flutterflow. While a large amount of code is generated in the background when working in the platform, this doesn't automatically translate into sluggish app performance. When working with Flutterflow, it's worth keeping in mind that any issues with speed and performance are likely to be limited to the Flutterflow editor itself.
One potential issue to be aware of is the CPU usage when typing long texts in text fields directly in Flutterflow. Each character typed triggers a real-time action throughout the editor to apply the changes, which could cause CPU usage to spike. However, this issue can be resolved by writing the text in a separate application and copying and pasting it into Flutterflow.​

Despite these minor issues, Flutterflow remains an excellent platform for developing apps. Users can create their first prototype and run it on a real device to experience impressive app performance firsthand. For those who need further inspiration or guidance, Flutterflow has a community of experts who have developed apps using the platform, which can be accessed at **https://experts.flutterflow.io/**.​
**In addition to this, there are a couple of factors that may cause slow performance in the Flutterflow editor.**The first is related to project size, where larger projects with numerous pages and components or a high volume of text fields could take up more memory and cause slower performance.​

Another factor is working on a project for a prolonged period without exiting or restarting the browser. Browsers have cache limits, and if the cache reaches its limit, it could slow down the Flutterflow editor significantly.​

To mitigate these issues, it's recommended to use the macOS version of Flutterflow if you are only working on UI elements. Additionally, it's a good idea to restart and hard refresh the browser periodically if you notice that the browser is slowing down.
By keeping these suggestions in mind, users can optimize their experience with the Flutterflow platform and continue developing high-quality apps efficiently.​

**Could not sign in as firebase@flutterflow.io to your Firebase project. Make sure "Email Sign-In" is turned on for your Firebase project, and try again.**
​
How To Resolve

1. Make sure Email Sign-In is enabled for your Firebase Authentication and that you've properly set up your Auth configuration.
2. To verify this, go to the Firebase console, select your project, then go to Authentication → Sign-in methods → Email/Password and ensure it's enabled.
3. Also verify that you have granted the necessary permissions to the FlutterFlow service account.

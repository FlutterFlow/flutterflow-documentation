Background
In some cases, FlutterFlow Content Manager (CMS) fails to sync with the project data that is held by FlutterFlow. This results in CMS not being able to access data from Cloud Firesstore .

![](../assets/20250430121204990541.png)Steps To  Fix
To fix this issue, you need to make some changes in your FlutterFlow project that wouldn't affect your project design; this will update the project appropriately, and then you can access the CMS.
If the error still persists after following the outlined steps, please contact support via Chat or Email at support@flutterflow.io.

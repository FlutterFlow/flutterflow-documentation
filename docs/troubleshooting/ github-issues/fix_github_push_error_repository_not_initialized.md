# Fix GitHub Push Error by Initializing the Repository

When pushing code to GitHub, you may encounter the following error:

```
Error pushing repository. Make sure your repository is initialized
```

This issue often occurs when your GitHub repository was not initialized correctly or if your project exceeds GitHub’s file size limits.


**Reinitialize Your GitHub Repository**

Follow these steps to properly initialize your repository:

    1. Go to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and create a new repository.
    2. Check the box for **Add a README file** during creation.
    3. After creation, follow the standard steps to connect your GitHub repository to FlutterFlow.

:::warning[Check Your Asset Size]
GitHub does not allow individual files larger than **25MB**. Large image or video files may cause push failures.
:::

**Check for GitHub Size Limits**
To review your file sizes:

    1. Download your project code.
    2. Open the `assets` folder.
    3. Identify files larger than 25MB.


:::tip[Recommended Fix]
To reduce project size:
- Use **network assets** instead of uploading large files directly.
- Optimize images before uploading.
:::

By ensuring your repository is initialized and staying within GitHub’s file size limits, you can avoid this push error.

# Resolve Repository Head Deployment Error on GitHub

When deploying your FlutterFlow app to the Apple App Store or Google Play via GitHub, you may encounter the message `Failed to set the repository head`. This typically means there's an issue with access permissions, a missing branch, or network configuration.

This article outlines the possible causes and step-by-step instructions to fix this issue.

:::warning[Deployment Error]
You may encounter the following error in your build log:
```
Failed to set the repository head
```
:::

Here are the possible causes of this error:

   - The GitHub repository does not exist or was deleted.
   - You do not have permission to access or write to the repository or the branch.
   - The branch specified in the build settings does not exist.
   - Network or API connectivity issues between GitHub and the deployment service.
   - The codebase contains build or structural errors that prevent deployment.


Use the steps below to resolve the error:

1. **Verify Repository Name**
   - Ensure the repository name in your FlutterFlow deployment settings matches the name in GitHub exactly.

2. **Check Branch Name**
   - Make sure the branch you are deploying from exists in the repository.
   - Avoid typos and capitalization mismatches.

3. **Review Access Permissions**
   - Confirm you have push/write access to the repository and the specific branch.
   - If using a service account or GitHub App, ensure it has appropriate scopes.

4. **Check Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure there are no firewall, VPN, or DNS settings interfering with GitHub access.

5. **Validate Code Locally**
   - Before deploying, ensure your project builds and runs successfully on your local machine.

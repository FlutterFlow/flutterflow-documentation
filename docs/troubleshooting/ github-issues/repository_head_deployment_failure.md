# Repository Head Deployment Failure

This error may occur when deploying your FlutterFlow app to GitHub using Codemagic. The message `Failed to set the repository head` indicates a problem with repository access, configuration, or connectivity.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- A connected GitHub repository with appropriate access permissions.
- GitHub deployment enabled within FlutterFlow.
:::

**The Error Message**

   ```js
   Failed to set the repository head
   ```
   This message typically appears in the build log during deployment.

Below are the possible causes of this error:

   - The GitHub repository does not exist or was deleted.
   - The branch specified in build settings does not exist.
   - Insufficient permissions to push or write to the branch.
   - GitHub API or network connectivity issues.
   - Local build errors in the codebase.

**Steps to Fix the Deployment Error:**

1. **Confirm the Repository Name**

   Ensure the repository name in your FlutterFlow deployment settings exactly matches the name in GitHub.

2. **Verify the Branch**

   Check that the branch exists in the repository and is correctly specified in your build settings. Avoid typos or casing mismatches.

3. **Review Repository Permissions**

   Confirm that your GitHub account or connected GitHub App has push/write access to the repository and branch.

4. **Check Network Access**

   Make sure your environment is not blocking GitHub via VPN, firewall, or DNS restrictions.

5. **Validate the Codebase Locally**

   Run the downloaded Flutter project locally to confirm that it builds without errors.

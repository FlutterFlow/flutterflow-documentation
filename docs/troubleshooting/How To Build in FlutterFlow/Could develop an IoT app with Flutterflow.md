# Could develop an IoT app with Flutterflow?

IoT stands for Internet of Things. An IoT app is a type of software application that is designed to work with devices connected to the Internet of Things. These devices can include things like smart thermostats, security cameras, and other smart devices that are connected to the internet and can be controlled and accessed remotely.
IoT apps allow users to monitor and control these devices from their smartphones or other devices and can be used to automate various tasks and processes.â€‹
**Yes, You can.**The only challenging part could be the connectivity part.
For connecting and managing the wireless connections etc. Maybe you need some integrations.

Always you can write some custom code and use Flutter packages in pub.dev
You can then use various packages and plugins to add IoT functionality to your app. Some packages and plugins that may be useful for building an IoT app in Flutter include:

**`flutter_blue`**: This package allows you to connect to and communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy devices from within your Flutter app.

**`iot_sensors`**: This package provides a set of common sensors for IoT applications, such as temperature sensors and accelerometers.

**`flutter_mqtt`**: This plugin allows you to connect to and publish messages to an MQTT broker, which is commonly used in IoT applications.

**`flutter_mqtt_client`**: This plugin provides a complete MQTT client implementation for Flutter, including support for secure connections and message persistence.

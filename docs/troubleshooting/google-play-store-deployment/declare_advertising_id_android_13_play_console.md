# Declare Advertising ID for Android 13+ in Play Console

If your app targets Android 13 (API 33) or higher, Google Play requires that you declare whether your app uses the **Advertising ID**. Failing to do so will result in an upload error when submitting artifacts to the Play Console.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- Your app targets Android 13 (API 33) or above.
- The app is being submitted via the **Google Play Console**.
:::

When uploading your app to Google Play, you may encounter this error:

    ```js
    {
    "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "message": "Your app targets Android 13 (API 33) or above. You must declare the use of advertising ID in Play Console.",
        "status": "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
    }
    }
    ```
    This error occurs when the required declaration for the Advertising ID is missing, incomplete, or inconsistent with your app configuration.

    Google Play now requires developers targeting Android 13 (API 33) or above to explicitly declare if their app uses the **Advertising ID**.

    You may see this error if:

        - You didn't complete the advertising ID declaration in the Play Console.
        - Your app configuration suggests ad usage but you have not declared it.
        - Your declaration is incomplete or missing required details.

Follow the steps below to fix this error:

1. **Open App Content Section in Play Console:**

    - Log into your **Google Play Console**.
    - Navigate to your app's **App Content** section.

2. **Declare Advertising ID Usage**

    - If your app **does not contain ads**, select **No** under the "Advertising ID" section.

    - If your app **contains ads**, select **Yes** and provide the necessary details about how ads are used.

        This Declaration is important because Google Play uses this information to:

            - Inform users about your appâ€™s data collection practices.
            - Ensure compliance with privacy policies.
            - Prevent build upload failures.

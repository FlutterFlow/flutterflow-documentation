# Fix Google Play Deployment Error: Failed to Read Key from Keystore

## Error Message

During deployment to the Google Play Store, you may encounter the following error:

```text
Error: Failed to read key ******** from store "/tmp/keystore.keystore"
```


---

## Why This Happens

This error typically occurs due to a problem with your keystore configuration, such as:

- Incorrect keystore file path
- Wrong keystore password or alias
- Corrupted or missing keystore file

---

## How to Resolve

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Your Keystore Setup**  
   Check that the keystore file is correctly configured in your FlutterFlow **Project Settings > Android Build** section.

2. **Check Keystore Credentials**  
   Double-check the **keystore password**, **key alias**, and **key password**. Make sure they match what you set when generating the keystore.

3. **Regenerate the Keystore**  
   If the issue persists, consider creating a **new keystore** within FlutterFlow and updating the credentials accordingly.

4. **Ensure File Integrity**  
   Confirm that you've uploaded the correct and **unmodified** keystore file.

When uploading your Android App Bundle (AAB) or APK to Google Play, you might encounter this error:

```text
You uploaded an APK or Android App Bundle that was signed in debug mode. You need to sign your APK or Android App Bundle in release mode
```
This error indicates the app must be signed with a release key before uploading.

**Steps to Fix Debug Signing Error:**
    1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file in your project folder.
    2. Locate the `buildTypes` section and find the configuration labeled `debug`.
    3. Replace the `debug` keyword with `release` in the relevant signing configuration.

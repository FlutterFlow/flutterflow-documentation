# Downgrade from Paid to Free Plan

When you cancel your FlutterFlow subscription, your account will automatically switch to a Free plan.

You will still have access to your existing apps and can continue making changes inside FlutterFlow.

However, premium features such as custom APIs, GitHub integration, Codemagic, and code downloads will no longer be available. These features will also stop working in Preview and Run modes.

:::note
Downgrading to a Free plan does not affect apps already deployed to Google Play or the App Store. Your projects remain stable, and you can upgrade again anytime to regain premium features.

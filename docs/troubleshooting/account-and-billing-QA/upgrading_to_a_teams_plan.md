If you add an existing FlutterFlow user to your Teams plan, they will need to manually cancel their subscription using these instructions. Once this is completed, please reach out to support@flutterflow.io or chat to process the refund for any remaining time on your monthly plan. We're working on automating this process soon!

## FAQs

Can I reduce my Teams plan to one seat?
No, you can't. The minimum requirement is two seats, which includes one for the owner's pro plan + an additional team seat.

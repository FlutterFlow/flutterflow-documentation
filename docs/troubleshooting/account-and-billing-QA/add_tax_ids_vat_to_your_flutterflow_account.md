# Add Tax IDs (VAT) to Your FlutterFlow Account

Adding a Tax Identification Number (VAT ID) to your FlutterFlow account ensures your billing information accurately reflects your business details for tax purposes. Follow the simple steps below to update your account:

:::info[Prerequisites]
In order to get started, you'll need to already have a FlutterFlow account. Be sure to sign up if you haven't already!

Be sure to review your account defaults before moving forward. By default, your account will have the name you entered at sign-up and the billing information associated with the card on file. You may need to update these so that they match your VAT information.

## Steps to update your account

### Contact Support for VAT or other Tax ID Additions

To add your VAT or other tax identifiers, please email support@flutterflow.io. In order to update your account to be tax-exempt, please provide the following information in your email:

- VAT ID

- Company Name

- Company Address

Using the details provided, our team will verify your tax ID and share confirmation or next steps.

### Additional Information

Due to limitations with our payment processor, Stripe, we cannot update past invoices with your VAT ID.  Your VAT ID will be applied to **all future invoices**, ensuring compliance with tax requirements.

By following these steps, you can easily add your VAT ID to your FlutterFlow account, helping to streamline your billing and tax reporting process.

# What Happens When I Downgrade From a Paid Plan to a Free Plan?

When you cancel your FlutterFlow subscription, your account will automatically change to a Free account.

You will still be able to access the apps you created and make changes inside of FlutterFlow.

However, you won't be able to access any premium features such as custom APIs, GitHub integration, codemagic, and code downloads. Additionally, premium features will no longer work in Preview and Run Mode.

:::note
Downgrading from a paid plan to a free plan will not have any impact on apps you deployed to Google Play and the App Store. Your projects will remain stable, and you can upgrade to a paid plan again at anytime to make changes.

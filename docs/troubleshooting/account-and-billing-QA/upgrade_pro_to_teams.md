# Upgrade Pro To Teams

You can upgrade your Pro account to Teams to collaborate with others and manage multiple seats under one subscription.

:::note
The person who initiates the upgrade becomes the team owner. The owner can set permissions, manage billing, and invite team members.
:::

To upgrade your Pro acccount to teams, take the following steps:

- **Open My Organization**: Log into your FlutterFlow account. In the left sidebar, click **My Organization**.

- **Create a Team**: In the My Organization section, click **Create Team**. Enter a team name to proceed.

- **Subscribe to Teams**: After creating your team, click **Subscribe** within the same My Organization section.

- **Select Number of Seats**: Choose the number of seats you need. Each seat represents one team member. You can add more seats later if needed.

- **Complete the Upgrade**: Follow the remaining prompts to confirm your subscription and complete payment.

:::note
Teams plans include collaboration features not available in Pro plans.

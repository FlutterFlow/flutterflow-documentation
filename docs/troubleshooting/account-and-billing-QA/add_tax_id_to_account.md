# Add Tax ID to account

You can add a tax identification number (VAT ID or other Tax IDs) to your account for billing and tax compliance.

:::info[Prerequisite]
You must have an active FlutterFlow account.
:::

**Contact Support to Add Tax ID**

To add your VAT ID or other tax identifiers, contact support by emailing support@flutterflow.io. Include the following information in your request:

    - VAT ID
    - Company name
    - Company address

    The FlutterFlow team will verify the provided tax information and confirm once the update is completed.

:::note
- VAT ID updates only apply to future invoices. Due to limitations with the payment processor (Stripe), previous invoices cannot be modified.
- Ensure that your account name and billing information match your business tax records before requesting changes.

    Adding your tax ID ensures your invoices are correctly formatted for tax reporting purposes.

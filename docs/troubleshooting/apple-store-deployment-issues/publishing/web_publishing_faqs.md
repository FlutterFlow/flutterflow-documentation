This article provides answers to frequently asked questions related to web publishing.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- Basic understanding of FlutterFlow and Flutter web projects.
- Access to FlutterFlow exported web project files.
- Familiarity with web hosting concepts.
:::

- **What certifications does FlutterFlow web hosting comply with?**

    FlutterFlow web hosting runs on Google Compute Engine. For detailed information about compliance and certifications, see **[Google Cloud Compliance](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance)**.

- **What are the system requirements for self-hosting a FlutterFlow web project?**

    FlutterFlow exports standard Flutter code. To compile and host Flutter web apps yourself, review the **[Flutter Web Deployment Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web)**.

    Compiled Flutter projects produce static files that can be hosted on most web servers without backend technology like Node.js or PHP.

- **Do I need backend technologies to host my FlutterFlow web project?**

    No, compiled Flutter web projects are static content. You can host them on any server capable of serving static files with proper MIME types.

- **What should I consider when hosting on a custom domain?**

    You need to configure DNS settings correctly and ensure SSL certificates are in place for HTTPS. See domain connection guides for more information.

- **Verify DNS Records**

    - Ensure that you have correctly configured the DNS records required for your custom domain connection.
    - Add the keys provided by FlutterFlow to your domainâ€™s DNS settings.

        :::note
        For A records, if your DNS provider requires a name, you can use **"@"**. When you see an empty value, it typically refers to **"@"**.

- **Check for Conflicting Records**

    - Review your DNS configuration to ensure there are no extra or unnecessary records that conflict with the FlutterFlow-provided keys.
    - For example, if you already have an A record using **"@"**, remove it to avoid conflicts.

        :::note
        Before removing any existing DNS records, take screenshots and save them for reference.

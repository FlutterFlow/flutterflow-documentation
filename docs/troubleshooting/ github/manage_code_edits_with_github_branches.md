# Manage Code Edits Without Overwrites When Using GitHub

When working with GitHub integration in FlutterFlow, itâ€™s important to understand how FlutterFlow manages branches to prevent your custom code edits from being overwritten.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- A FlutterFlow project linked to a GitHub repository.
- Basic understanding of Git branches and merge workflows.
:::

FlutterFlow pushes updates only to the `flutterflow` branch of your GitHub repository. You **should not** make local changes directly to this branch, as they will be **overwritten** every time the project syncs from FlutterFlow.

Follow the steps below to safely make and retain local code changes:

1. **Push from FlutterFlow to GitHub**  
   This sends the latest generated code to the `flutterflow` branch.

2. **Create a New Branch for Local Edits**  
   Checkout a separate branch (e.g., `main`) and copy the code from the `flutterflow` branch into it.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b main
   git merge flutterflow
   ```

3. **Make Changes on Your Custom Branch**
   Apply any local modifications on the custom branch (not on flutterflow).

4. **Push Again From FlutterFlow When Needed**
   When you push new changes from FlutterFlow, it will update the flutterflow branch. Your custom branch will remain unchanged.

5. **Merge and Resolve Conflicts**
   After FlutterFlow updates the flutterflow branch, merge it into your custom branch and resolve any conflicts:

      ```js
      git checkout main
      ```
      ```js
      git merge flutterflow
      ```
      This allows you to selectively retain or discard changes as needed.

:::warning
Do not make direct changes to the flutterflow branch, as any future push from FlutterFlow will overwrite it.

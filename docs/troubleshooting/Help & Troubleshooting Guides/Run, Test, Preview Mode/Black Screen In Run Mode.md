![](../../assets/20250430121528287666.png)
Please follow these steps:

Right-click in the middle of the screen (where the device is usually shown) and select **Reload Frame.**

If this does not work, try **changing the device** (left side of your screen).

If this does not work, try **refreshing the page**.

If this does not resolve your issue, try upgrading to the latest version of FlutterFlow Ctrl + R on Windows or Cmd + R on Mac. After you have done this, clear your browser cache and log in/out of FlutterFlow.

If these troubleshooting steps don't resolve your issue, please submit a bug report.

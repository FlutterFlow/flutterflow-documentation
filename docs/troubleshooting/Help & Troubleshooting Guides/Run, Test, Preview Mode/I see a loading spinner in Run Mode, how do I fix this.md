# I see a loading spinner in Run Mode, how do I fix this?

If you see a loading spinner in run mode then please try to run the application once again after updating your project's Firestore rules.â€‹
Here are the steps to update Firestore rules:

Go to **Firestore** and then select **Settings**.

Copy the Firestore rules by selecting the copy icon.

Next, go to Firebase console and open you application. 

Select **Firestore Database** and then select the **Rules tab.**

Paste the copied rules(from FlutterFlow) there.

Now return to FlutterFlow and re-run your project

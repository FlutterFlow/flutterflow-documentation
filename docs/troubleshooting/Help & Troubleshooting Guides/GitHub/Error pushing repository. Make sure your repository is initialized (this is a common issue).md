# Error pushing repository. Make sure your repository is initialized (this is a common issue)

**Reinitialize Repository**
To fix this error, you will need to initialize your GitHub repository using these steps:

Create a new GitHub repository using these steps. Make sure you check the box that says **Add a README file**.

**Ensure You Haven't Exceeded GitHub Size limits**
GitHub does not allow individual assets that are larger than 25MB. â€‹
You can easily check your asset size by downloading your code and reviewing the assets folder.

To reduce your project size, we recommend using network assets (vs. uploading the assets directly).

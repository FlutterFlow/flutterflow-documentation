# Can I Build Web Apps or Websites?

FlutterFlow generates code that can run as a web application. However, there are important limitations and considerations to be aware of.

---

## 1. Official Support Status

> **Note:** FlutterFlow does not officially support Flutter Web yet.

- The generated code should run as a web app, but you may encounter issues.

---

## 2. Known Issues

- Scrolling issues on iOS Web
- iOS video player and YouTube player may not work

---

## 3. Deployment Limitations

- You cannot deploy a web app directly from within FlutterFlow.
- To deploy, follow [Flutterâ€™s official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web#deploying-to-the-web).

---

## 4. Additional Resources

- [Flutter Web Deployment Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web#deploying-to-the-web)
- [FlutterFlow Docs](https://docs.flutterflow.io/)

> **Summary:**
> - Web code generation is possible, but not officially supported.
> - Some features may not work as expected, especially on iOS.
> - Deployment must be done outside of FlutterFlow.

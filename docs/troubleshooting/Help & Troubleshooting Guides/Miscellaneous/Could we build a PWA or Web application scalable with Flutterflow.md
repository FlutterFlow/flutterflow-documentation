# Can You Build a PWA or Scalable Web Application with FlutterFlow?

FlutterFlow enables you to build client-side applications—including dashboards and PWAs—quickly and efficiently. Here’s what you need to know about scalability, reusability, and deployment.

---

## 1. What is Possible with FlutterFlow?

- **Build any client-side app:** Dashboards, internal/external apps, and more.
- **Cross-platform:** Target Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux thanks to Flutter’s cross-platform capabilities.
- **No vendor lock-in:** Export your code and continue development outside FlutterFlow at any time.

---

## 2. Productivity & Reusability

- **Low-code builder:** Drag-and-drop interface lets you build apps up to 10x faster than traditional development.
- **Design System:** Build themes and reusable components once, then use them across multiple projects.
- **Shared libraries:** Reuse custom code and APIs across projects by adding them to your organization’s shared library.

---

## 3. Integration & Extensibility

- **Third-party integrations:** Use REST APIs or custom code to connect with any service.
- **Reusable components:** Create simple or complex components in the design system and drag them into any project.

---

## 4. Subscription & Pricing Model

- **Developer-based pricing:** Subscription is based on the number of developers, not end users.
- **No runtime charges:** You can have 10 or 10 million users—FlutterFlow does not charge for app usage.
- **Backend costs:** If you use services like Firebase or Supabase, those providers may charge for infrastructure and usage.

# How do I add collaborators or team members to my project?

With FlutterFlow, it's easy to manage your project team members and collaborate on projects.

**Important:** A user added to your project will only have access to the features of their account plan.

You can use these steps to add a teammate to your project:

Select **Settings &amp; Integrations** from the left Navigation Menu.

Under the **Project Setup**, select **Team**.

Click on the **Invite User**. This will open a popup to enter your team member's email.

Input their **email address **and select **Invite**.

If the user isn't already a FlutterFlow user, we will send them an invite email. Their status will be shown as **Pending **until they create an account.

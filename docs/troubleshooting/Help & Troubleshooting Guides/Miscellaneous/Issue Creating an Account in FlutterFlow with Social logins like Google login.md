# Issue Creating an Account in FlutterFlow with Social logins like Google login?

If you're trying to create an account with Google in FlutterFlow, but recieve the following error: "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call."​
Solution
This error typically occurs because the browser blocks pop-ups. The issue is particularly common in newly created profiles on Chrome or freshly installed Chrome browsers.​
Allow Pop-ups and Redirects
A major factor causing this issue could be the blocking of pop-ups by your browser. To resolve this, you'll need to allow pop-ups and redirects for your domain. Follow these steps:

**Click on the Lock Icon:** Locate and click on the lock icon situated next to the URL in your address bar.

**Navigate to Site Settings:** From the dropdown menu, click on 'Site settings.'

**Find the Right Setting:** Scroll down until you find the 'Pop-ups and redirects' setting.

**Change to Allow:** Switch this setting to 'Allow.'

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of creating an account with Google in FlutterFlow.​

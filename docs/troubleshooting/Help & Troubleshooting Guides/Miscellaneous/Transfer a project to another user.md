# Transfer a project to another user

**⚠️ Note:** This step can not be undone. If you want to regain project ownership, the new project owner will need to transfer ownership back to you.
Overview
If you have a FlutterFlow project in your account and you'd like to make someone else the owner of that project, you can transfer your project over to that other user with just a few clicks.

Instructions
Follow these steps to remove a teammate from your project:

Select **Settings &amp; Integrations** from the left Navigation Menu.

Under the **Project Setup**, select **Team**.

Click on the Role (e.g. **Editor**) of the person you want to transfer project ownership to. You can only transfer ownership to someone with a status of **Active.**

A popup will appear and select **Yes.**

- **Solution:**
    - Ensure your custom code matches the expected structure and types.
    - Compare your code with the generated boilerplate to spot differences.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3: Unsaved Changes**
- Sometimes, you may forget to save your changes before compiling.
- **Solution:**
    - Always click the **Save** button after editing code and before compiling.

## 3. Additional Tips

- Double-check for typos or subtle mismatches in your code and configuration files.
- If the problem persists, try cleaning your build (`flutter clean`) and rebuilding the project.
- Consult the [official support article](https://intercom.help/flutterflow/en/articles/8076318-compilation-fails-despite-the-compiler-not-showing-any-errors) for more troubleshooting steps.

> **Summary:**
> - Check for package version conflicts
> - Ensure custom code matches expected structure
> - Save all changes before compiling

By following these steps, you can resolve most cases where compilation fails without visible errors.

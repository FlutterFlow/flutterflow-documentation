# Frontend (UI builder) issues

In case of overflowing text, it's recommended that you wrap the Text Widget inside an Expanded widget. To do this just click on the Expand option in the alignment properties of the Text Widget.

If you notice scaling issues with widgets then please make sure that you set percentage values for the dimensions of the widgets.

When renaming a custom widget or custom action, please make sure that you rename the widget from the code as well.

Please make sure not to upload duplicate media assets in the Project Media Assets.

Make sure you've entered the correct API keys when using third-party integrations.

Clear your browser cache and history if FlutterFlow seems to be laggy.

Change browser or use incognito/private browsing mode if you're not able to start from the login screen when using the Test/Run mode.

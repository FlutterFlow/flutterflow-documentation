# I'm having issues scrolling inside of FlutterFlow / I can't scroll.

FlutterFlow does not have scroll bars. Instead, just hover over the section and scroll as you would normally.
If the issue persists, please try these troubleshooting steps:

Try using a mouse. There are some known issues with Flutter and trackpads on Windows computers.

Check your scrolling settings. For example, Windows may require two fingers to scroll.

If you aren't using Google Chrome, switch to Google Chrome.

If the issue persists, please reach out to us at support@flutterflow.io.

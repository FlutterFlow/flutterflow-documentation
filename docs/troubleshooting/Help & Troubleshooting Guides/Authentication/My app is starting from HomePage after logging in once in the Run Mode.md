# My app is starting from HomePage after logging in once in the Run Mode

If your app always starts from the HomePage after logging in once (especially in Run Mode), this is likely due to cached authentication or session data in your browser.

## Troubleshooting Steps

- **Clear your browser cache and history.**
- **Try a different browser** or use **incognito/private browsing mode** to see if the issue persists.

If the problem continues, consider checking your authentication flow and session management in your app settings.

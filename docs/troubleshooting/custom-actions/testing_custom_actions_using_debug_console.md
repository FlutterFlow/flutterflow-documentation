# Testing Custom Actions using Debug Console

Sometimes, the compiler does not show any errors in the custom action, but the custom action still won't work as expected. This might be due to the code logic or the implementation. In order to test the implementation and the flow, you can use the debug console to test the custom action in different scenarios.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- You have created a custom action in FlutterFlow.
- You are familiar with using Run Mode and viewing the browser console.
:::

The core function that you can use to test the custom actions on the console is the `debugPrint` function in Flutter. To use that in the custom actions, follow the steps below:

1. **Add `debugPrint` Statements in the Code**

    Use `debugPrint` to print some error on the debug console in case of a specific result. You can use if-else statements or try-catch statements in order to test the success of the scenario.

    Example:

    ```js
    try {
        final result = someFunction();
        debugPrint('Function result: $result');
    } catch (e) {
        debugPrint('Error occurred: $e');
    }

2. **Run the App and Open Console**

    After the correct implementation in the code, use the action inside the app. On the run mode, open the console. Now you should be able to see the errors in the console upon performing the action.

# Fix Google Login Issues During Sign Up

If you're unable to sign up for FlutterFlow using Google or another social login and see an error like:

    ```text
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.`
    ```

    This issue is commonly caused by your browser blocking pop-ups and redirects, especially on new or freshly installed Chrome profiles.

:::info[Prerequisites]
This article is intended for users who are signing up for a FlutterFlow account using Google or another social login.
:::

To resolve the Google Login Sign-Up issue, enable pop-ups and redirects for FlutterFlow in your browser:

    1. **Open Site Settings**

        - Click the **lock icon** next to the URL in your browser’s address bar.
        - Choose **Site settings** from the dropdown.

    2. **Allow Pop-ups and Redirects**

        - Scroll down to the **Pop-ups and redirects** section.
        - Set it to **Allow**.

If enabling pop-ups doesn’t resolve the issue:

    - Try using another browser (e.g., Firefox or Edge).
    - Ensure no browser extensions are blocking authentication.
    - Restart the browser and attempt login again.

If the issue persists, [contact FlutterFlow support](support@flutterflow.io) for further assistance.

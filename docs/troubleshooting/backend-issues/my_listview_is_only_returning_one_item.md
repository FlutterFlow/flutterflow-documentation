# My listview is only returning one item


## Things to check if you listview is only returning one item

Here are the things to check if you are facing this issue:

## - Use a dynamic widget

    Make sure you are using a **ListView**, **GridView**, **Row**, or **Column** to dynamically generate the children.

## - Query for a list
    Ensure your query is for a **list of documents** and not a single record.

## - Check filters
    If you are using a filter, make sure the data present in Firestore has **more than one record** that can pass through the filter.

## - Sufficient records
    Make sure that your Firestore collection has **enough records**.

## - ListType field 

    If you are querying a single field, make sure itâ€™s a **ListType field** in both FlutterFlow and Firebase.

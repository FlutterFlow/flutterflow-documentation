# Can't Download APK or Code in FlutterFlow

**Check Your Browser Permissions**
The most common cause of issues downloading APKs or project code is insufficient permissions in your web browser. To download your code, you'll need to give FlutterFlow permission for pop-ups and redirects.

For Chrome, please follow these steps:

Select the **lock icon** in the website address bar.

A popup will appear. Ensure it says **Allow **next to pop-ups and redirects.

Additionally, we recommend you **Allow Clipboard **as well. You need this to copy-paste widgets within FlutterFlow.

Once done, try downloading the APK again.

***Tip: The download will be saved in your default download folder. ***​​

**Resolve Project Errors**

You won't be able to download your APK or code if your project has errors. If you see a red indicator (example below) in your project issues, this means you have unresolved errors you need to address. It should also show an error mentioning to fix the errors before building the APK.​
After resolving all the issues, you should be able to download the APK

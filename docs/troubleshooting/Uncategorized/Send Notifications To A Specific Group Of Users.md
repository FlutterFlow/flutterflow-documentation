# Send Notifications To A Specific Group Of Users

Use Case
FlutterFlow enables users to schedule and trigger notifications. When a document is created, you may want to automatically send notifications to a selected group/category of users from the user's collection. In certain scenarios, you may want to automatically send notifications to a specific group or category of users from the user's collection when a new document is created. This article details a step by step instructions on how to achieve this.
Sample Project
We've created a sample project to demonstrate how to build this in FlutterFlow:
https://app.flutterflow.io/project/auto-notification-2bm5hzâ€‹Keep reading for step-by-step instructions to learn how you can build what we have created in our sample project.

Send Notification To A Specific Group Of Users
Project Configuration

Ensure your project is set up correctly with Firebase.
- Here are detailed instructions on how to set up Firebase in Flutterflow

Ensure  **`firebase@flutterflow.io` **account has all the necessary permissions.
-  Here are detailed instructions on how to enable access to your project 

To send notifications, your project must be in the Blaze plan. 

Enable Push notifications in your projects and deploy them.

Send Notifications

Send notifications to multiple users from the user's collection once a post is added;

In submit button, add a backend query
- Set Query type to `Query Collection`
- Collection to your data source collection, i.e `users`
- Query type to `List of Documents` click `save`

Add create document action to the button

Set the value to the parameters sent to firebase

add another action, trigger notification action

Set notification parameters with the necessary data i.e (title, message, initial page)

In the recipient section, select multiple recipients

Click on the `unset` section, a pop will show

Select `user document` as the source of data

In the available options, select `filter list items`

```
Note : To send to a specific group you must have filter attribute in the users collection. i.e (isPremium) 
```

Click `unset` under  `filter conditions`, a pop will show

Select `Items in list` , under document properties, select `isPremium`
- This will send notifications to all users who `isPremium`  attribute is set to `True`

Click `Confirm` , this will pop you back to the previous dialog

In this pop, under available options, select `Map List Items`

Click `unset` a pop will show, and under `Document Properties` select `Reference`

Click `Confirm`` in all pop-ups

Close the action chain

The notification will be triggered automatically once a new post has been sent successfully.

# Can I Import Modified Source Code Back into FlutterFlow?

Currently, FlutterFlow does **not** support importing source code that has been manually edited in an IDE (such as Android Studio or VS Code) back into the FlutterFlow platform.

> **Note:**
> You can still run your modified source code from GitHub in Test Mode, but you cannot sync those changes back into the FlutterFlow visual builder.

If you need to make custom code changes, it's recommended to maintain those changes outside of FlutterFlow and manage your workflow accordingly.

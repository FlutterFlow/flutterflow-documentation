# SVG Image Missing Color on Real Device

Your SVG images may appear correctly on the web but lose their colors when viewed on a physical mobile device. This guide walks through potential causes and solutions.

## Problem

SVG images render correctly on the web, but when viewed on an actual mobile device, the colors do not appear as expected or are completely missing.

## Common Causes

- **Unsupported color modes**: Devices may not support certain modes like CMYK. Use RGB for best compatibility.
- **Missing color attributes**: If `fill` or `stroke` values are not defined, the image might appear colorless.
- **Incorrect display attributes**: Attributes like `display: none;` can prevent parts of the SVG from rendering.
- **Improper embedding or file path**: The SVG might not be correctly linked or referenced in the project.
- **Device color settings**: Display settings such as grayscale or color filters may affect SVG rendering.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Test with another SVG**  
   Swap in a different SVG file to check if the issue is file-specific.

2. **Inspect the SVG in a text editor**  
   Confirm the presence of `fill` and `stroke` attributes and ensure valid color values are set.

3. **Open SVG in a mobile browser**  
   See if the issue is specific to the app or also appears in the browser.

4. **Check mobile display settings**  
   Ensure the device's display is not applying grayscale or color filters.

5. **Try alternative software for exporting SVG**  
   If you're exporting from a design tool, experiment with different settings or software to preserve color information.

## Summary

SVG rendering issues on real devices are often due to file structure or device compatibility. Testing with multiple tools and verifying proper color attributes in your SVG file can help resolve this issue.

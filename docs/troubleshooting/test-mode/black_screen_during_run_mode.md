    Use the device selector on the left panel to switch to a different preview device.

3. **Refresh the Page**

    Press `Ctrl + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + R` (Mac) to refresh the browser.

4. **Update FlutterFlow and Clear Cache**

    - Ensure you are using the latest version.
    - Clear your browser cache.
    - Log out and back in to your FlutterFlow account.

5. **Submit a Bug Report**

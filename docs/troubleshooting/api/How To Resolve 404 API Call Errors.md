# Resolving 404 API Call Errors

Standard API status codes are returned when unsuccessful API calls are made in FlutterFlow. One of the most common errors is the **404 (Resource Not Found)** status code. Here's how to understand and resolve it.

## Understanding the 404 Error

The `404` error means that the requested resource could not be found on the server. This is typically due to:

- An incorrect endpoint URL.
- A missing resource ID or parameter in the request.
- Backend service not deployed or incorrectly configured.

## How to Resolve It

1. **Verify the API URL**  
   Double-check that the base URL and endpoint path are correct. Typos or incorrect paths will result in a 404.

2. **Check Request Parameters**  
   Ensure that any required query parameters, path variables, or headers are included and properly formatted.

3. **Validate API Key and Authentication**  
   Some APIs return a 404 if authentication is missing or incorrect to prevent information leakage.

4. **Ensure the Resource Exists**  
   If your call is trying to fetch or modify a specific item, make sure that the resource actually exists in the backend.

5. **Test Outside FlutterFlow**  
   Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoint directly and confirm that the backend is returning the expected data.

6. **Consult API Documentation**  
   Review the API docs to ensure you're using the endpoint correctly, including the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

## Summary

The 404 error is a common but fixable issue when working with APIs in FlutterFlow. By validating URLs, checking resource existence, and ensuring proper parameters, you can quickly debug and resolve these errors.

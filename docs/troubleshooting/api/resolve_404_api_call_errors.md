# Resolve 404 API Call Errors in API Calls

When working with APIs in FlutterFlow, you may encounter `404` errors, which indicate that the requested resource was not found. These are standard HTTP status codes typically triggered by incorrect endpoint configurations or missing parameters.

This article outlines what a 404 error means and how to troubleshoot it within your API call setup.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- A configured API call in FlutterFlow.
- Access to the API documentation for the external service you are integrating.
:::

## Common Reasons for 404 Errors

1. **Incorrect Endpoint URL**  
   Double-check that the base URL and endpoint path are spelled correctly and match whatâ€™s defined in the API documentation.

2. **Missing or Incorrect Parameters**  
   Some APIs require specific query or path parameters. Ensure that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted.

3. **Trailing Slashes**  
   Some endpoints treat URLs with trailing slashes (e.g., `/users/`) differently than without (e.g., `/users`). Try removing or adding the trailing slash to see if it resolves the issue.

4. **Authorization or Access Restrictions**  
   If the endpoint exists but is protected, ensure that the correct headers (e.g., `Authorization`) are added to the request.

   Example Error Message:

      The error message typically includes the requested URL and response code, which can help narrow down the issue.

:::tip
Always compare the URL structure in your FlutterFlow API call to the official documentation of the API provider. Use tools like **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** to test endpoints independently before implementing them in FlutterFlow.

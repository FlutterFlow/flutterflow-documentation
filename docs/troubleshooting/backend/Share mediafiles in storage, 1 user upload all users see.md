# Share Media/Files in Storage â€” 1 User Upload, All Users See

If a user uploads a file to Firebase Storage but other users canâ€™t see it â€” even with the same parameters â€” the issue likely relates to **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** settings on your Firebase Storage bucket.

This guide walks you through how to update the CORS policy so media and files uploaded by one user are accessible by others.

## Problem

Media or files uploaded to Firebase Storage by one user arenâ€™t visible to other users, even though the correct parameters are used in your app.

## Solution

Youâ€™ll need to set a public CORS policy on your Firebase Storage bucket using the Google Cloud CLI.

### 1. Install `gsutil`

Follow Googleâ€™s guide to install `gsutil`:

ðŸ‘‰ [Install gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)

### 2. Create a `cors.json` file

Save the following JSON content in your project directory as `cors.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

3. Apply the CORS configuration
  Run the following command in your terminal to set the CORS policy for your Firebase Storage bucket: 

    ```js
    gsutil cors set cors.json gs://exampleproject.appspot.com
    ```

    Replace exampleproject.appspot.com with your actual Firebase project bucket name.

    After updating the CORS settings, any file uploaded by one user should now be visible to all users with access, assuming theyâ€™re using the same query logic and paths.

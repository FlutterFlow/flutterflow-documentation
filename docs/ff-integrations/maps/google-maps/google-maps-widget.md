# Google Maps Widget

The **Google Maps** widget enables the integration of interactive maps into your app, offering users
valuable geographical insights. For instance, in a food delivery app, this widget could display the
locations of restaurants. It offers a range of customization options, allowing you to tailor the
display with various map types and markers to suit your specific needs.

:::danger[Feature Completion]
As we continuously enhance our platform, please note that while our integration is robust, it is not
yet feature-complete. We encourage you to review the available APIs and features detailed below to
ensure they meet your app development needs before integration.

:::info[Prerequisite]
Ensure you have added the [**Google Map API keys**](generate-maps-keys#get-api-keys) before adding the Google Maps widget to your project

## Add Google Map widget

1. Open the Widget Palette and locate the **Google Map** widget under the **Base Elements** tab. You
  can
  drag it to your desired location or add it directly from the widget tree or canvas area.

2. By default, the map displays a random location. To set a specific location, go to the
  **Properties Panel > Initial Location**.

3. Enter the latitude and longitude values in the **Lat and Lng** fields to specify the location. To
  use the user's current location, set a variable through the **Set Variable menu > Global
  Properties > Current Device Location**.

4. To change the map type, go to the **Properties Panel > Map Type** and select one of the following
  options:
    - **Roadmap:** Displays the default road map view.
    - **Terrain:** Shows a physical map based on terrain information.
    - **Hybrid:** Combines normal and satellite views.
    - **Satellite:** Displays satellite images from Google Earth.

5. To customize the visual appearance of your map, navigate to the **Properties Panel > Map Style**.

6. To set the **initial zoom level** of the map, go to the **Properties Panel > Initial Zoom** 
   of Map and enter the desired value. Note that a higher value will zoom in on the map while a lower value will
  zoom out.

## Markers

A marker is an icon that appears over the map, indicating a location. To add markers:

- Select the **Google Map** widget, move to the **Properties Panel > Num Markers** and select
  whether you
  want to show **Single** or **Multiple** markers.

### Set Markers from Firebase

- Set the Marker Type to **Document** if the data is on Firestore Collection

- In case of Documents, create a collection and query it on any widget (must be a parent of
  GoogleMap) or page.

- In Marker Document, set the source of markers as shown in the following video.

### Set Markers from List of LatLng

If you choose **LatLng**, you must provide a source that contains a list of locations as Data Type
(LatLng) (e.g., App State > [variable_name] (List of **LatLng**)).

engaging, while also aligning with your app's branding. To set an image as a marker:

- Move to the **Properties Panel > Google Map > set the Marker Icon to Image**.

- Select the type of image you want to set:
    - For an image hosted online, set the Image Type to **Network** and specify the image URL in the
      Path field.

## On Marker Tap [Action Trigger]

dynamically displaying additional information about the location, opening a detailed view, or
initiating other actions based on the selected marker.

Hereâ€™s how you do it:

- Select the **Google Map** widget.
- From the Properties Panel, select **Actions** and open the **Action Flow Editor**.
- Under the action trigger **On Marker Tap**, add any actions here.

## Advanced Customizations

You can customize the appearance and behavior of this widget using the various properties available
in the properties panel.

### Allow Interacting With the Map

By default, the map interaction feature is enabled, allowing users to drag, zoom in, and zoom out on
the map. However, you can disable the **Allow Zooming the Map** and **Show Zoom Buttons** on the Map
options
if you wish to restrict the zoom functionality.

To access these settings, navigate to the **Properties Panel > Google Map > Allows Interacting with
the Map**.

To enable this option, navigate to the **Properties Panel > Google Map > enable the Show User
Location toggle**.

:::note

## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Why Google Maps custom markers are not working in run mode or test mode?</summary>
<p>
Due to a recent update, Google Maps custom markers won't work in Run or Test mode unless CanvasKit is enabled. This is expected behavior. To use custom markers effectively, enable CanvasKit from [**Advanced Web Settings**](../../../resources/projects/settings/project-setup.md#advanced-web-settings).

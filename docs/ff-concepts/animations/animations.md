Adding animations to your app enhances the user experience. A well-choreographed animation can make the app look and feel more intuitive.

In FlutterFlow, you have the following options to add animations to your app:

- Widget Animations: allow you to add animations to specific widgets, like a a shimmer effect on a container

- Hero Animations: allow you to gracefully transition from one screen to another

- Animations imported from Rive or Lottie: allow you to build out visually complex animations

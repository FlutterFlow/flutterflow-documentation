# Build Scalable Web Applications with FlutterFlow

FlutterFlow allows you to build high-performance, client-side web applications—including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and internal tools—with a focus on scalability and maintainability.

:::info[Prerequisites]
- A FlutterFlow account with a web-compatible project.
- A basic understanding of responsive design and Flutter widgets.
- (Optional) A hosting platform such as Firebase Hosting or Vercel for web deployment.
:::

**Platform Capabilities**

    - **Client-side applications:** Build dashboards, PWAs, and internal or external apps.
    - **Cross-platform deployment:** Publish to Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux using Flutter.
    - **Code export:** Download your full source code and continue development outside of FlutterFlow with no vendor lock-in.

**Productivity and Reusability**

    - **Low-code builder:** Accelerate development using drag-and-drop functionality—up to 10x faster than traditional methods.
    - **Design System:** Create themes and reusable components once and use them across multiple projects.
    - **Shared libraries:** Consolidate and reuse custom code, actions, and APIs across your organization’s projects.

**Integration and Extensibility**

    - **Third-party APIs:** Connect to any external service using REST APIs or custom code.
    - **Custom components:** Build complex or reusable components in the design system and drag them into multiple screens or apps.

**Pricing and Scalability**

    - **Developer-based subscription:** Billing is based on the number of team members, not end users.
    - **No usage-based charges:** FlutterFlow does not charge based on the number of users or sessions.
    - **External backend costs:** If you're using services like **Firebase** or **Supabase**, charges will be based on their pricing models.

FlutterFlow provides a scalable, low-code platform for building web applications and PWAs. Its component-based design system, cross-platform support, and code export capabilities make it ideal for teams that need flexibility, speed, and full ownership over their codebase.

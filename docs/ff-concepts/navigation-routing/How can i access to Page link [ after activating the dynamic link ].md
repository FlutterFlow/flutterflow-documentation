When you activate dynamic links, you gain access to **page-specific links**. This allows you to share or route users to exact screens within your app.

## Important Note

If you enable dynamic links, you must use `"https"` for the URL scheme.

## How to Set Up Dynamic Links in FlutterFlow

To share or use the current page URL, follow these steps:

1. **Add an Action**: Use the `Generate Current Page Link` action to create a dynamic link for the active screen.

2. **Access the Page URL**: Once generated, the page URL becomes accessible through the **Widget State â†’ Current Page Link**.

3. **Use It in Another Action**: For example, on your **Share** button, add:
   - A `Generate Current Page Link` action first
   - Then a `Share` action using `Current Page Link` as the source

# GenUI Chat

Usually, applications follow a fixed model: developers design screens, define navigation, and hard-code interactions. Users are limited to these predefined flows, and anything outside those paths simply isn’t supported.

With GenUI, your app provides agent-driven experiences. Instead of relying on rigid flows, an AI agent can assemble user journeys dynamically in real time. Developers no longer need to predict every scenario. Instead, they define the building blocks and the AI orchestrates them into meaningful, context-aware experiences for the user.

This represents a fundamental shift, from building fixed applications to building flexible capabilities that an agent can compose on demand.

For example, a user asks, “Show my recent orders.” Instead of responding with text, the agent renders **order card components** with details like items, price, and delivery status. The user then asks, “Where is my latest order?” Now, instead of showing another block of text, the agent switches to a **map component** to display the live delivery location. This demonstrates how the agent dynamically selects the most relevant UI component based on the user’s intent.

:::note
This doesn’t replace traditional UI. Navigation, dashboards, and structured flows still play an important role. GenUI introduces a **new layer,** dynamic, adaptive, and conversational, that handles the long tail of use cases traditional interfaces can’t efficiently cover.
:::

## Three Pillars of GenUI

GenUI introduces three core pillars that work together to transform your app into an agent-driven experience:

**1. Component Catalog:** Instead of replying with plain text, the AI uses your FlutterFlow components, such as product cards, booking tiles, or dashboards, to present information directly in the interface. Users don’t read the text; they interact with real UI.

**2. Tools:** Your existing FlutterFlow action blocks become capabilities the AI can use. Whether it’s fetching data, calling APIs, submitting forms, or triggering workflows, the AI can execute these actions and use the results instantly. It moves beyond conversation and starts performing real tasks inside your app.

**3. App Event Integration:** Your app’s events provide real-time context to the AI. Things like user actions, state changes, or backend updates can trigger responses. With auto-response enabled, the AI doesn’t wait for input; it proactively reacts and updates the experience as things happen.

## Adding GenUI

Follow the steps below to add GenUI Chat to your app:

1. Make sure you’ve completed the [Firebase integration](../../../ff-integrations/firebase/connect-to-firebase-setup.md), including the [initial setup](../../../ff-integrations/authentication/firebase-auth/auth-initial-setup.md) and configuration files.
2. Go to **Firebase Console > AI Logic** and enable it.
3. In your FlutterFlow project, place the **GenUI Chat** widget on a page or component like any other FlutterFlow widget.
4. Go to the Properties panel and define domain instructions to guide how the assistant behaves and communicates in your app. These instructions help the AI understand your app’s context, tone, and what it should prioritize. If left empty, it defaults to a generic assistant that builds UI in response to user requests.

    **Example System Prompt:**
    `You are a helpful AI shopping assistant for an e-commerce app. Help users discover products, compare options, track orders, and complete purchases.`

5. Select the components that the AI is allowed to render in responses. To learn how to configure components for GenUI, refer to the [Component Catalog](component-catalog.md) documentation.
6. If needed, add the [Action Blocks](../../../resources/control-flow/functions/action-blocks.md) that the AI can call. Note that only Action Blocks that return a value can be added. To learn how to configure them for GenUI, refer to the [Tools Configuration](tools-configuration.md) documentation.
7. If needed, choose Local [App Events](../app-events.md) to connect to the conversation. To learn how to configure app events for GenUI, refer to the [App Events Integrations](app-event-integrations.md) documentation.

## Examples

#### 1. Customer Support Agent

**Traditional Approach:** Build a help center with FAQ pages, a ticket form, and a chatbot that matches keywords to canned responses.

**GenUI Approach:**

- **Catalog Components:** TicketStatusCard, FAQArticle, EscalationForm, SatisfactionSurvey, AgentContactCard
- **Tools:** `lookupTicket(ticketId)`, `searchKnowledgeBase(query)`, `createTicket(details)`, `getCustomerHistory(customerId)`
- **App Events:** `NewTicketUpdateEvent` (auto-respond) when a support ticket is updated in the backend, the AI proactively informs the user

A user opens the support chat. They describe their issue in natural language. The AI searches the knowledge base using the tool, finds a relevant article, and renders it as a FAQ Article component. If that does not resolve the issue, the AI creates a ticket using `createTicket`, shows the TicketStatusCard with the new ticket ID, and says it will notify them of updates. Later, when the support team updates the ticket, a `NewTicketUpdateEvent` fires, and the AI proactively shows the updated TicketStatusCard with the resolution.

The developer did not build a "ticket lookup flow" or a "knowledge base search screen." They built components and tools. The AI composed the journey.

#### 2. E-Commerce Personal Shopper

**Traditional Approach:** Build product listing pages, filters, a search bar, a comparison tool, a cart, and a checkout flow.

**GenUI Approach:**

- **Catalog Components:** ProductCard, ComparisonTable, PriceHistoryChart, ReviewSummary, CartSummary, PromoCodeBanner
- **Tools:** `searchProducts(query,filters)`, `getProductDetails(productId)`, `getReviews(productId)`, `addToCart(productId,quantity)`, `applyPromoCode(code)`, `getPriceHistory(productId)`
- **App Events:** `CartUpdatedEvent` (context injection) keeps the AI aware of what is already in the cart; `FlashSaleEvent` (auto-respond) alerts the user about time-sensitive deals

A user says, "I need a gift for my dad who likes woodworking and coffee." The AI searches products, shows a curated set of ProductCards, and when the user shows interest in a specific item, pulls up the ReviewSummary and PriceHistoryChart. The AI knows what is in the cart (via CartUpdatedEvent context) and can suggest complementary items. When a flash sale starts on a relevant product, the AI proactively shows the PromoCodeBanner.

No search results page. No filter sidebar. No "compare" button. The AI built a personalized shopping experience from the components and tools available to it.

## Current Limitations

Here are some important limitations and considerations to keep in mind:

- The only supported backend today is **Firebase AI Logic**.
- App event listeners currently work only with **LOCAL** app events.
- Catalog components cannot expose action parameters.
- Avatar images are passed to the generated widget as string URLs and rendered using `NetworkImage`.
- Each rendered surface supports only a single catalog component as its root.

## Behind the Scenes
A high-level overview of the underlying architecture and systems that power GenUI.

### Architecture

GenUI is powered by [**Firebase AI Logic**](https://firebase.google.com/products/firebase-ai-logic) (Google Gemini) as its LLM backend. The architecture flows from proto definitions through codegen to a generated runtime:

- **Proto schema** (`FFGenUIChatWidgetProperties`) defines the widget's configuration: backend type, system prompt, catalog component keys, function configs, app event listener configs, and styling.
- **Codegen pipeline** (the `GenUIModule`) generates two types of files per project:
    - A **shared widget** (`ff_genui_chat.dart`) containing the `FFGenUIChatConfig` class and `FFGenUIChat` StatefulWidget, generated once and reused by all GenUI chat instances.
    - **Per-widget tools files** (`<widget_name>_tools.dart`) containing `DynamicAiTool<JsonMap>` definitions for each action block exposed to the AI.
- **Widget generator** (`GenUIChatCodeGen`) produces the per-widget instance code: building the `FFGenUIChatConfig` with resolved system prompt, component docs, function docs, app event docs, catalog, content generator factory, and styling options.
- **Runtime** uses the [`genui`](https://pub.dev/packages/genui) and [`genui_firebase_ai`](https://pub.dev/packages/genui_firebase_ai) packages:
    - `GenUiConversation` manages conversation state (ValueNotifier-based).
    - `A2uiMessageProcessor` parses AI tool calls into widget renders.
    - `FirebaseAiContentGenerator` handles LLM streaming via Firebase AI Logic.
    - `Catalog` / `CatalogItem` provide the component registry with JSON schemas and widget builders.

### GenUI Is Built on A2UI

GenUI is FlutterFlow's implementation of [**A2UI (Agent-to-UI)**](https://a2ui.org/). An [open project by Google](https://github.com/google/A2UI) that defines a declarative UI protocol for agent-driven interfaces. A2UI allows AI agents to generate rich, interactive UIs that render natively across platforms (web, mobile, desktop) without executing arbitrary code.

## Best Practices

#### Build Primitives, Not Paths

Build **self-contained components** that represent a single unit of information or interaction, and **tools** that represent a single operation. The AI will compose them into paths you never anticipated.

**Before:** The user clicks 'View Order' -> navigates to OrderDetailPage -> sees order info + tracking + items list

**After:** Build `OrderSummaryCard`, `TrackingStatusCard`, `OrderItemsList` as separate catalog components. Build `getOrderDetails` as a tool. The AI decides what to show based on what the user asks.

#### Describe Everything

The AI reads your component and parameter descriptions to decide what to render and what values to provide. The quality of your descriptions directly impacts the quality of the AI's responses.

- Name components clearly: `ProductCard` not `Card1`
- Name parameters descriptively: `estimatedDeliveryDate` not `date`
- Add descriptions to parameters: "The product's price in USD" not just "price"
- Add descriptions to action blocks: "Searches the product catalog and returns matching items with prices and availability" not just "search"

The AI is only as smart as the vocabulary you give it.

#### Design for Composition

Components and tools work best when they are designed to be composed:

- **Retrieval Tool + Display Component:** `getOrderDetails()` returns an `OrderStruct` -> `OrderStatusCard` accepts an `OrderStruct` as a parameter. The AI calls the tool and passes the result to the component.
- **Granular Over Monolithic:** A `ProductCard`, `ReviewSummary`, and `PriceChart` give the AI three options. A single `ProductDetailPage` component gives the AI one.
- **Consistent Data Types:** Use the same DataStruct across related tools and components. If `searchProducts` returns `ProductStruct`, make `ProductCard` accept `ProductStruct`.

#### Use Events for Temporal Awareness

App events give the AI a sense of time and change. Without them, the AI only knows what the user tells it. With them, the AI knows what is happening.

- Use **auto_respond: false** for continuous state awareness, such as user navigation, preference changes, background data updates.
- Use **auto_respond: true** for time-sensitive signals, such as alerts, completions, threshold breaches, incoming messages.

#### Write System Prompts Like Onboarding Documents

The system prompt is the AI's job description. Write it like you are onboarding a new team member:

- What is their role?
- What domain should they know about?
- What should they prioritize?
- What should they never do?
- What tone should they use?
- What business rules must they follow?

A great system prompt makes the difference between a useful assistant and a generic chatbot.

## FAQS

<details>
<summary>
The widget builds but the AI only sends text
</summary>

<p>
Check the catalog first. If no component fits the request, text is the expected fallback. Also, confirm that your system prompt and component descriptions make it clear when each component should be used.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I can't add a component to the catalog
</summary>

<p>
The most common causes are:

- The component has an action parameter.
- A required complex parameter is missing a default value.
- The component was deleted or renamed after being configured.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I can't add an Action Block as a tool
</summary>

<p>
The Action Block must return a value, and every parameter, plus the return type, must be supported by the tool serializer.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
My event listener is not firing
</summary>

<p>
Make sure the following are correctly set:

- The event is LOCAL scope.
- The right event is being triggered at runtime.
- `auto_respond` is set the way you expect.
- You are looking at GenUI logs when debugging.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why does a component fail validation?
</summary>

<p>
Common reasons include:

- It has an action parameter.
- It is configured twice in the same catalog.
- A required complex parameter is missing a default value.
- The configured component no longer exists.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why is the model choosing the wrong component?
</summary>

<p>
Usually one of these is true:

- The names are too generic.
- Parameter descriptions are weak.
- Multiple catalog components overlap too much in purpose.
- The system prompt does not explain how the assistant should prioritize them.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Can the model render multiple items?
</summary>

<p>
Yes, but the reliable pattern is to use a single catalog component that accepts a list rather than expecting the model to assemble multiple independent sibling components on its own.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why is the model not calling a tool?
</summary>

<p>
Usually, the issue is not codegen. It is tool discoverability:

- The name is vague
- The description is weak
- The system prompt does not make it clear when the tool should be used
- The model already has enough context to answer without calling it
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What happens when a tool fails?
</summary>

<p>
The generated tool code catches the exception, clears the loading state, and sends an error payload back to the model. The UI should remain stable, and the model can decide how to explain or recover.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why can't I select my event?
</summary>

<p>
The event must be <strong>LOCAL</strong> scope and must still exist in the project or dependency where it was defined.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why didn't the assistant respond immediately?
</summary>

<p>
Check the following:

- whether `auto_respond` is actually `true`
- whether the event is being triggered
- whether the system prompt tells the model to react visibly

Note: Even with immediate inference, not every event will result in a visible response.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why does the assistant only react on the next user message?
</summary>

<p>
That is the expected behavior for `auto_respond: false`. The listener queues hidden context instead of triggering a separate inference call.
</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Can one GenUI widget listen to the same event twice?
</summary>

<p>
No. Duplicate listeners for the same event on the same widget are rejected during validation.
</p> 
</details>

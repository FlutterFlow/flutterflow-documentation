# File Handling

FlutterFlow makes it easy to manage, upload, download, and display files within your app. It supports a variety of file types, including images, videos, and documents, and integrates seamlessly with popular storage solutions. Using built-in widgets and actions, you can effectively manage your app's media. This guide covers the following key aspects of file handling in FlutterFlow.

- **Media Assets**: Upload any assets you want to use in your app from the Navigation Menu > Media Assets. This also shows the media assets of the [Team](../../accounts-billing/subscriptions/flutterflow-for-teams.md).
- [**Uploading Files**](uploading-files.md): Upload and save different file types, including images, audio, videos, and PDFs to cloud storage.
- [**Displaying Media**](displaying-media.md): Fetch files from cloud storage or external URLs and display them in your app.
- [**Download Files**](download-file.md): Allow users to download files directly to their devices.
- [**Clear or Delete Media**](clear-delete-media.md): Allow users to delete uploaded files from their devices and cloud storage.

- **Request Permissions**: [**Request user permissions**](../../resources/projects/settings/project-setup.md#request-permission-action) when implementing custom widgets or actions that access personal information, such as capturing photos or selecting images, especially if no built-in permission mechanism is available.

# Downgrade from Paid to Free Plan

This article explains what happens when you cancel your FlutterFlow subscription and your account is downgraded to the Free plan.

:::info[Prerequisites]
You must have an active FlutterFlow account with a paid subscription.
:::

Here is what happens after downgrading:

- **Account Plan Change**  
   After canceling your subscription, your account will automatically switch to the Free plan.

- **Project Access**  
   You will retain access to your existing apps and can continue editing them in the FlutterFlow editor.

- **Feature Restrictions**  
   Premium features such as:
   - Custom API integration  
   - GitHub integration  
   - Codemagic build services  
   - Code download and export  
   - Access to premium widgets and components  
   
   will no longer be available.

- **Preview and Run Limitations**  
   Features like custom APIs and external integrations will no longer work in **Preview** or **Run** modes.

:::note
Downgrading does not affect live apps already published on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Projects remain functional, and premium features can be restored by upgrading your plan again.

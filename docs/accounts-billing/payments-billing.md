## FAQs

<summary>Can I add a Tax ID (e.g. VAT) to my invoice?</summary>

Yes! You can add a Tax Identification Number (VAT ID) to your FlutterFlow account so that it appears on **all future invoices**.

To do this, please contact our support team at [support@flutterflow.io](mailto:support@flutterflow.io) with the following information:

- VAT ID  
- Company Name  
- Company Address  

Our team will verify your details and confirm once the VAT ID has been applied.

:::note
Due to Stripe’s current limitations, we cannot update past invoices with your VAT ID. It will only apply to **future invoices**.

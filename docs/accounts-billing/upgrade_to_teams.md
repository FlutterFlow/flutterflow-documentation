# Upgrade to Teams Plan

This article explains how to upgrade your FlutterFlow subscription from a **Pro** plan to a **Teams** plan to enable collaboration and multi-seat management.

:::info[Prerequisites]
You must be logged into a **Pro** FlutterFlow account.
:::

**Steps to Upgrade to the Teams Plan:**

   1. **Open My Organization**  
      In the left sidebar of the FlutterFlow dashboard, click **My Organization**.

   2. **Create a Team**  
      In the **My Organization** section, click **Create Team**.  
      Enter a **team name**, then proceed.

   3. **Subscribe to the Teams Plan**  
      After creating the team, click **Subscribe** in the same section.

   4. **Choose Number of Seats**  
      Select the number of seats you want.  
      Each seat represents one team member. You can add or remove seats later.

   5. **Complete the Upgrade**  
      Follow the remaining prompts to confirm your subscription and complete payment.

:::note
The person who initiates the upgrade becomes the **Team Owner**. The owner can manage billing, set permissions, and invite team members.

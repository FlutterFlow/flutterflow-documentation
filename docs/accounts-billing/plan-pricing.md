## Pricing Update

We’re excited to announce an update to our pricing plans, making them simpler and more tailored to how you use FlutterFlow.

[why we are doing this - intentionally left blank – to be completed]

### What's Changing?

As part of a platform-wide evolution, FlutterFlow is updating its pricing and packaging model effective **July 14, 2025**. The update introduces new plan tiers aligned with team size, simplifies billing, and ensures better alignment between user needs and platform capabilities.

**Key Changes**

- We're retiring our legacy plans—**Standard**, **Pro**, and **Teams**—and introducing a new, simplified lineup: **Free**, **Individual**, **Growth**, **Business**, and **Enterprise**.
- If you're already using FlutterFlow, don’t worry—you’ll be automatically moved to the new plan that best fits your current team size. No action needed on your part.
- That said, feature access will look a little different. Some users will gain powerful new capabilities, while others might see a few features move to higher tiers.

### Detailed Plan Changes

Below are the details on all the changes so you’ll know exactly what to expect:

## FAQS

<details>
<summary>
Who is affected by this pricing change?
</summary>
<p>
All FlutterFlow users will move to the new structure as of July 14, 2025.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
When does the new pricing take effect for me?
</summary>
<p>
The new pricing and packaging will go into effect for all users on July 14, 2025. Your billing and feature access will automatically update on that date.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
How do I know which plan I will be moved to?
</summary>
<p>Your new plan will be determined based on your current <strong>team size</strong>, like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solo users will move to the <strong>Individual</strong> plan.</li>
  <li>Teams of 2 will move to the <strong>Growth</strong> plan.</li>
  <li>Teams of 3–5 will move to the <strong>Business</strong> plan.</li>
  <li>Teams with 6+ users will have a choice to stay on the <strong>Business</strong> plan for a period of 12 months as part of a bundling solution.</li>
  <li>Users on the free plan will stay on the free plan, but with new feature restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We’ll notify you directly in the app and by email before the July 14 transition, so you’ll have a chance to review or adjust your plan if needed. If you’re unsure, contact us and we’ll help you confirm your new plan.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What if I am currently on a Teams plan with 6+ users and do not want to migrate to the Enterprise plan – how will I be charged in the Business tier?
</summary>
<p>
Teams with more than 5 users who do not wish to move immediately to an Enterprise contract will be priced based on bundles of 5 seats under the Business tier. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A team with 6–10 users will be charged $500 × 2 = $1,000/month.</li>
  <li>A team with 11–15 users will be charged $500 × 3 = $1,500/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows larger retail teams to continue operating under the Business feature set but note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No Enterprise-only features are included.</li>
  <li>If the team exceeds Business tier limits, they will be prompted to upgrade to Enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This bundling option is available only to existing 6+ seat teams and for 12 months to ensure continuity without immediate contract negotiation.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What if I don’t want to switch plans?
</summary>
<p>
All existing plans will be retired on July 14, 2025, and users will be automatically transitioned to the new pricing structure based on their current usage. This helps us simplify billing, improve feature alignment, and deliver a more consistent experience across all teams.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to review your options or adjust your usage ahead of time, our support team is here to help. We recommend logging into your account to see how your team maps to the new tiers and reaching out if you have specific needs.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
How do I know which plan is right for me?
</summary>
<p>We recommend:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual:</strong> Solo builders or hobbyists</li>
  <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Two-person teams looking to quickly iterate with minimal collaboration requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Business:</strong> Teams of 3–5 collaborating on production apps</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Larger teams needing advanced security, governance, and collaboration features</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I am a Free user and I will lose access to technical support. Where else can I look to for help when building?
</summary>
<p>While direct technical support will no longer be included with the Free plan, we offer a collection of self-serve resources to help you continue building with confidence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New troubleshooting guides and updated Help Center documentation will be available to walk you through common issues and workflows step-by-step</li>
  <li>You can turn to our Community Forum to ask questions, share learnings, and get help from other FlutterFlow builders.</li>
  <li>We also offer free educational content via our YouTube channel and on Coursera to support your learning and skill development.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resources are designed to help you succeed — even on a Free plan — without needing to rely on 1:1 support.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What’s included in the Enterprise plan?
</summary>
<p>The Enterprise plan is built for organizations that need advanced security, scale, and white-glove support while managing production-grade apps across teams. In addition to all features available in lower tiers, Enterprise includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Controlled FlutterFlow upgrades through version pinning</li>
  <li>Unlimited snapshotting for project history and rollback</li>
  <li>Custom SSO and audit logging for secure, centralized access</li>
  <li>Unlimited development environments to mirror staging, QA, and production workflows</li>
  <li>Advanced accessibility features to meet regulatory requirements</li>
  <li>Ability to opt out of AI training</li>
  <li>Custom AI assistant prompt limits for tailored automation</li>
  <li>Database point-in-time recovery (PITR) for enterprise-grade continuity</li>
  <li>No automatic right to use your logo</li>
  <li>Live and dedicated technical support, plus access to custom engineering solutions when needed</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more or explore a custom Enterprise solution for your team, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@flutterflow.io">sales@flutterflow.io</a> – we'd be happy to walk you through options that match your scale and needs.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What if I have projects with multiple collaborators?
</summary>
<p>
Starting July 14, 2025, you will no longer be able to collaborate with other users outside of your plan (Growth or Business). All existing collaborators will convert to view-only access.
</p>
<p>
To collaborate with users across multiple organizations, we encourage you to buy separate plans as appropriate.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What if I want to continue collaborating with project collaborators who are not on a Teams plan with me?
</summary>
<p>With the new pricing model, collaboration is only supported within shared Teams plans. This means that to work together on a project, all collaborators must be part of the same Growth, Business, or Enterprise team.</p>
<p>Project-level collaboration (where individuals outside your team could be added to specific projects) is being phased out to simplify permissions, ensure security, and support shared billing.</p>
<p>If you would like to continue collaborating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can invite others to join your team (additional seats may require an upgrade depending on your plan).</li>
  <li>Or, they can create a new team and invite you, depending on who should own billing and project access.</li>
</ul>
<p>This change ensures that every project has clear ownership, consistent permissions, and a scalable path for team-based collaboration.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I’m an agency – which plan works best for me?
</summary>
<p>Agencies have a few options depending on their team size and how they work with clients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your agency has 5 or fewer users, we recommend the Business plan, which supports up to 5 collaborators with advanced features like branching and access control.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your agency has more than 10 users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We recommend you to encourage your client to purchase seats in a Business plan and invite your agency team members as collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<p>For agencies with 10 or more developers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We recommend you explore custom agency pricing tailored to your model by reaching out to us at <a href="mailto:partners@flutterflow.io">partners@flutterflow.io</a> and gain access to volume discount pricing.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Will my existing FlutterFlow apps stop working?
</summary>
<p>
No, your current apps will continue to function, and you will still be able to edit all existing projects. However, access to certain features may change depending on your new plan tier starting July 14, 2025.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What happens to features I already use but which move to a higher tier?
</summary>
<p>
Access to features will be updated according to your new plan as of July 14, 2025. If you’re currently using a feature that is moving to a higher tier, there are two possible outcomes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Build-time features</strong> (like audit logs, version pinning, or publishing new deployments) will no longer be accessible. You’ll see an upgrade prompt if you attempt to use them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run-time features</strong> (like API endpoints, branching, or dev environments) will be grandfathered and continue to work as-is, but you won’t be able to create additional instances beyond what you already have. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>If you already have 3 API endpoints, you can continue editing them, but won’t be able to add a 4th without upgrading.</li>
      <li>If you’ve used branching or added multiple development environments and currently exceed your new plan limits, those remain active but you’ll be prompted to upgrade if you try to add more.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This approach ensures existing work isn’t disrupted, while still aligning future access with your selected plan.
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Can I switch early to benefit from lower Individual pricing?
</summary>
<p>
No, the new pricing tiers will not be available for purchase until July 14, 2025. However, to facilitate the loss of features, Free users will receive a 50% discount for the first three months when upgrading between July 14, 2025 and September 30, 2025.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I have more than 2 projects on a free plan. What happens to my projects on July 14, 2025?
</summary>
<p>
Starting July 14, 2025, new Free plan accounts will be limited to 2 active projects. As an existing user, if you currently have more than 2 projects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will still be able to edit all of your projects. No projects will be deleted or locked.</li>
  <li>However, to create a new project, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Important: If you later upgrade and then downgrade back to the Free plan, only the first two projects you originally created will remain editable. All additional projects will become view-only unless you upgrade again.
</p>
<p>
This policy ensures long-term fairness across plans while still honoring your work as an early user.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Do my existing FF apps still deploy if I stay on Free with >2 projects?
</summary>
<p>
Yes, any projects already live will remain deployable. However, on the new Free plan, you’ll be limited to maintaining and publishing up to 2 live projects. To manage more, an upgrade will be required.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
How will prices change with respect to country discounts?
</summary>
<p>
Localized pricing will continue where applicable. If you’re in a supported region, your billing will reflect adjusted rates at existing discounts based on your location.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
I have special access. How will this change impact me?
</summary>
<p>
If you currently have special access (such as through a community program, academic use, or other exception), your account will transition to the new Individual plan as part of the upcoming pricing changes.
</p>
<p>
Special access is designed to enable and the Individual plan best reflects that purpose. Notably, this plan includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlimited projects</li>
  <li>Code export and app store deployment</li>
  <li>Multiple API endpoints</li>
  <li>Technical support</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your needs change or you begin collaborating as a team, you can always explore our team-based plans.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Can I belong to multiple teams? How will that be billed?
</summary>
<p>
Yes, users can belong to multiple teams in FlutterFlow. Each team is treated as a separate billing entity, with its own plan, users, and usage limits.
</p>
<p>
If you are added as an editor on more than one team, you will count toward the seat total on each of those teams and will be billed separately within each team’s subscription.
</p>
<p>
All Teams plans (Growth, Business, Enterprise) feature centralized billing. This means a single admin manages payment, seats, and upgrades for the entire team. This setup simplifies subscription management and ensures all editors and collaborators are aligned under one payment method per team.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You’ll only be charged on a team if you’re assigned an editor role. Viewers do not count toward billing.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Can I share projects across multiple teams?
</summary>
<p>
No, projects cannot be shared across multiple teams. Each project belongs to a single team, and access is managed within that team’s structure.
</p>
<p>
If you want someone from another team to collaborate on a project, they must be invited into your team and assigned a role (e.g., editor or viewer). They will then count toward your team’s seat usage and billing if added as an editor.
</p>
<p>
This approach ensures consistent permissions, secure collaboration, and clean billing across organizations.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Will the referral program still exist with the new packages, now that the Pro plan is going away?
</summary>
<p>
With the retirement of the Pro plan, our current referral program will also be sunset. We’re evaluating what a future referral or incentive program could look like under the new pricing structure and would best support our community moving forward.
</p>
</details>

# Enabling Firebase Auth in FlutterFlow

:::tip[Skip if...]
...you have already enabled authentication while creating a [**new project with Firebase setup.**](..%2F..%2F..%2FFirebase%2FConnect%20to%20Firebase%20Setup.md)
:::

To enable authentication in FlutterFlow:

- Open your FlutterFlow project where you are planning to use Firebase
  Authentication.

- Open **Setting and Integrations > App Settings > Authentication**.

- Turn on the Enable Authentication toggle and select **Authentication Type** to
  **Firebase**.

- To ensure that your users are directed to the appropriate pages based on their
  login status, you must set the **Initial Page**.

### Setting Initial Pages for Authentication

You can specify your app's **Entry Page** and **Logged In Page** from this section.

- **Entry Page** : This page will be displayed if the user is not logged in. This is
typically used to display the onboarding flow or to provide the login/sign-up
page.

- **Logged In Page**: This page will be displayed if the user is already logged in to
your app. Users are automatically navigated to the page you specify here on a
successful sign-in attempt.

## Creating the 'users' collection

:::info[Prerequisities]
To allow FlutterFlow to create user documents during authentication steps, it is
important to enable Firestore Access in Firebase. Follow this section to enable
it first.
:::

The 'users' collection stores the information for authenticated users.

:::tip[Skip if...]
...you have already enabled 'Create User Collection' while creating a new
project with a Firebase setup.

:::

- Click on the Firestore tab from the Navigation Menu (left side of your
  screen).

- Click on the **+ Create Collection** button. If you have any other collection
  already added, you can click on the Plus button.

- Enter a collection_name (this can be anything, but we recommend 'users') and
  click on Create button.

- If you enter 'users' a popup will open which asks you to populate this
  collection with default fields. You can click Yes, and we will add all the
  fields.

:::tip[Add Default Fields if skipped previously]

- Click on the Settings icon in the Firestore tab.

- Find the **Users Collection** switch and enable it.

- Find the **Collection** dropdown below, click on the **Unset**, and select the
  name of
  the collection you just created.

- Now switch to the **Collection** tab. Now you should see all the default
  fields.

To store and collect additional information or modify the default fields list,
see how to add fields.

:::warning[ WARNING]
You do not need to create a password field. This is handled internally by
Firebase.
:::

## Setup for Google or Phone sign-in setup for Android Apps

:::tip[OPTIONAL]
If you aren't planning to use **Google** or **Phone Sign-In**, you can skip these steps.
:::

### Generate the SHA-1 key

An SHA-1 key (aka the 'Secure Hash Algorithm') is required if you want to use
Google Sign-in and Phone Sign-in. To learn more about the SHA-1 key, see
this [link](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth).

:::warning[Release Guidelines]
While releasing the app, make sure
to [**get the key from Play Console**](https://docs.flutterflow.io/data-and-backend/firebase/authentication/phone-sign-in#release-mode).
:::

1. Open a terminal window:

- **Mac**: Use the Launchpad or press (âŒ˜ + Spacebar) for Spotlight search,
  type 'Terminal', and open it.

- **Windows**: Click the Windows icon, navigate to the 'Windows System' folder,
  and open 'Command Prompt' either by clicking or right-clicking it.

2. Copy the following command (based on your operating system) and select Enter.

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>
  <div>
   ```keytool -list -v -keystore C:\Users\leon\.android\debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey```

    If you get the following error while trying the above command:

```ERROR:'keytool' is not recognized as an internal or external command```

    You might not have JAVA installed on your machine. [Here](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/keytool-command-not-found-how-to-fix-windows-macos/) is the helpful link to install JAVA and remove the above issue.

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Mac/Linux</summary>
  <div>
   ```keytool -list -v \ -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore``` 
  </div>
</details>

3. After being prompted for the key password, type 'android' and press 'Enter'.
   Note: For security reasons, you won't see the password as you type it.
4. Copy the SHA1 key.

#### Add the SHA-1 key in the Firebase Console

- Open the **Firebase console > Project Overview > Project Settings** and scroll
  down to Your App section.

- Select your Android App from the left side menu.

- Find the SHA certificate fingerprints section and click on the Add
  fingerprint.

- Enter the copied SHA-1 into the input box and click on Save.

### Regenerate config files

After adding the SHA-1 key you must re-generate the config files in FlutterFlow.

To regenerate the config files:

- Return to FlutterFlow. From the Navigation Menu, select **Settings &
  Integrations > Project Setup > Firebase**.

- Click on the Regenerate Config Files.

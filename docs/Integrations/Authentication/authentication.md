# Authentication 
Authentication allows users to create an account and log in to your app. We support Firebase, Supabase, and Custom Authentication. Under App Settings, choose Authentication, and then you can enable authentication. Choose the initial pages for the entry and logged-in states, and complete further steps if applicable.

## Firebase Authentication
In FlutterFlow, you can seamlessly connect with Firebase and utilize the available authentication methods. 

Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, leveraging industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. This makes it highly adaptable for use with your custom backend, ensuring a secure and scalable solution.

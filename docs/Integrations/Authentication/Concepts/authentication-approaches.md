# Authentication Approaches

In the world of apps, users can associate with applications through
various authentication methods, such as email login, OAuth, phone
authentication and more.

Each approach has its own unique features but shares a common
goal: to ensure security and verify the identity of users.

## Email Login Authentication

The email login method involves users registering with an email address and
password. Security in this approach is enhanced through email verification,
where a link or code is sent to the user's email to confirm ownership. This step
prevents unauthorized account creation and ensures that the user can recover
their account and receive important communications.

## OAuth (Open Authorization)

**OAuth** is a popular authentication protocol that enables users to authorize
one
application to interact with another on their behalf without revealing their
password. This method is commonly used to allow applications to access service
features or user information from other services, such as logging into a
third-party app using Google or Facebook credentials.

By using OAuth, the user's
login credentials stay secure with the original service provider, and only
specific permissions are granted to third-party apps via access tokens. This
approach minimizes the risk of exposing sensitive user data and streamlines the
login process across various platforms.

## Phone Authentication
Another method is phone authentication, where a user's phone number is used as a
form of identity verification. Upon registering or logging in, the user receives
a text message with a verification code that must be entered to proceed. This
method leverages the security of mobile networks and the uniqueness of phone
numbers to ensure that the person attempting access is the legitimate owner of
the account.

Each authentication method aims to balance user convenience with high security,
ensuring that personal and sensitive data remains protected while providing a
seamless user experience.

When you create a custom data type in the FlutterFlow editor, a corresponding class is generated in the code to act as a structured container for your data, similar to a `Struct`. This class includes simple getters and setters for each field. For example, if your data type in FlutterFlow is named "Product", the generated class will be named `ProductStruct` and can be found in the `product_struct.dart` file.

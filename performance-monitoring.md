# Performance Monitoring

[Firebase Performance Monitoring](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon) is a tool that *automatically* collects performance data from your app and provides insights through the Firebase console. It can monitor both network requests and specific parts of your code.

Enabling performance monitoring is beneficial for:

- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Discover where your app's performance is lagging.
- **Improve User Experience**: Slow or unresponsive apps lead to a poor user experience.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Make optimization decisions based on real performance data.
- **Monitor Network Calls**: See how long network requests take, helping identify slow APIs or network issues.

To enable performance monitoring, navigate to Settings and Integrations > Project Setup > Firebase > Open the Performance Monitoring section and Enable Performance Monitoring toggle.
